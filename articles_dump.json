To win a defamation case, you need to prove a few things. Most importantly, you need to prove the statements were false and that they were made with actual malice, otherwise known as a reckless disregard for the truth.\nIn a\nmajor pretrial ruling on March 31\n, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis ruled Dominion had successfully proven that all 20 statements mentioned in its lawsuit against Fox were false.\n\u201cThrough its extensive proof, Dominion has met its burden of showing there is no genuine issue of material fact as to falsity\u2026 The evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,\u201d\u00a0Davis wrote.\nLink Copied!\nFox\u00a0settlement papers were signed minutes before announcement, Dominion lawyer says\nFrom CNN\u2019s Danny Freeman\nDominion Voting Systems\u2019 co-lead counsel Justin Nelson said he and Dominion\u2019s other attorneys were expecting to go to trial\u00a0against Fox News\u00a0on Tuesday.\nThe final deal\u00a0to settle the case with the right-wing network for $787.5 million\u00a0came late in the day, and the settlement papers with Fox were signed just \u201cminutes\u201d before the agreement was announced, he said.\nPrior to the last-minute settlement, Nelson told CNN he and other attorneys had been preparing opening statements \u2013 even during the two-and-a-half-hour\u00a0courtroom\u00a0delay after the lunch recess.\nLink Copied!\nHere's how it looked inside the courtroom during the Fox vs Dominion case today\nFox News will pay more than $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems after lawyers from both sides hammered out a last-minute settlement of the defamation case launched against the right-wing network.\nThe deal\nwas announced hours after the jury\nwas sworn in at the Delaware Superior Court. Rumors of a settlement swirled in the courthouse when, after a lunch break, the proceedings dramatically ground to a halt for nearly three hours with no explanation, while the parties apparently hammered out an accord.\nCNN\u2019s Bill Hennessy, court sketch artist, captured scenes from inside the courtroom:\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis, center, with Dominion attorney Justin Nelson, left, and Fox attorney Dan Webb, right.\n(Sketch by Bill Hennessy)\nMembers of the public are seen in the foreground, with Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis on the far right.

Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my Company, our employees, and our customers. Nothing can ever make up for that,\u201d Poulos said in the statement. \u201cThroughout this process, we have sought accountability and believe the evidence brought to light through this case underscores the consequences of spreading and endorsing lies.\u201d\nLink Copied!\nSmartmatic says its pending case will further expose Fox News' wrongdoing after Dominion settlement\nFrom CNN's Jon Passantino\nSmartmatic representative demonstrates his company's system on August 30, 2018, at a meeting of the Secure, Accessible & Fair Elections Commission in Grovetown, Georgia.\n(Bob Andres/Atlanta Journal-Constitution/AP/FILE)\nSmartmatic, the voting technology company that is\u00a0suing Fox News for $2.7 billion for defamation said its pending case will further expose wrongdoing by the right-wing network, following the last-minute settlement in\nthe case brought by Dominion Voting Systems\n.\n\u201cDominion\u2019s litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox\u2019s disinformation campaign. Smartmatic will expose the rest. Smartmatic remains committed to clearing its name, recouping the significant damage done to the company, and holding Fox accountable for undermining democracy,\u201d said a statement from Smartmatic attorney J. Erik Connolly.\nLink Copied!\nDominion attorney says settlement represents a \"ringing endorsement for truth and accountability\"\nFrom CNN\u2019s Liam Reilly and Laura Dolan\nAttorney Justin Nelson\n(Matt Rourke/AP)\nThe settlement for more than $787 million with Fox News represents \u201ca ringing endorsement for truth and accountability,\u201d the attorney representing Dominion Voting Systems said Tuesday.\n\u201cThe truth matters. Lies have consequences,\u201d said Justin Nelson of the Susman Godfrey law firm at a news conference outside the courthouse.\nNelson said that more than two years ago a \u201ctorrent of lies\u201d had swept Dominion and election officials across America, causing \u201cgrievous harm to Dominion and the country.\u201d\nNelson also said the country must \u201cremain ever vigilant to find common ground.\u201d\n\u201cFor our democracy to endure for another 250 years and, hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts,\u201d Nelson added.\nLink Copied!\nAnalysis: This is an unequivocal rebuke of Fox News\nAnalysis From CNN's Elie Honig\nDaniel Webb, lawyer for Fox News, center,  leaves the Leonard Williams Justice Center in Wilmington, Delaware, on April 18.\n(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images)\nThe $787.5 million settlement in the Fox-Dominion case is an unequivocal rebuke of the right-wing news network and its journalism, said Elie Honig, former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\u201cTranslated it means we\u00a0got caught lying by the judge\u00a0\u2013 and I think that\u2019s exactly why\u00a0we are seeing this absolutely\u00a0jaw-dropping number,\u201d Honig told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper.\nAlthough the amount is about half of what Dominion was asking for, it\u2019s still an astonishing sum, he said.\n\u201cI\u00a0didn\u2019t think there was any way\u00a0they would get $1.6 billion \u2013 even\u00a0when they proved their case,\u00a0even if they proved it\u00a0overwhelmingly to a jury. Let\u2019s\u00a0remember, by its own estimation, Dominion valued the entire\u00a0company at somewhere between $30\u00a0and $80 million. This settlement\u00a0is 10 times the value of\u00a0Dominion as an entire company. That\u2019s how strong a statement this is with this number,\u201d Honig explained.\nLink Copied!\nDominion still has pending lawsuits against election deniers such as Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell\nFrom CNN's Marshall Cohen\nDominion Voting Systems still has pending lawsuits against right-wing networks Newsmax and OAN, as well as against Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell.\nAll of these parties and entities deny wrongdoing and are fighting the lawsuits.\nLink Copied!\n\"Fox has admitted to telling lies,\" Dominion CEO says\nFrom CNN's Nicki Brown\nJohn Poulos, the CEO of Dominion Voting Systems\n(CNN)\nFollowing the announcement of a $787.5 million dollar settlement in the Fox News-Dominion case, John Poulos, the CEO of Dominion Voting Systems, said Fox News \u201cadmitted to telling lies\u201d about the company.\n\u201cFox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,\u201d Poulos said.\n\u201cNothing can ever make up for that,\u201d Poulos added at a news conference following court.\n\u201cI cannot thank the election officials that we serve enough. Without them, there is no democracy,\u201d he said.\nLink Copied!\nOn-air claims about Dominion Voting Systems were false, Fox News says in statement\nFrom CNN's Jon Passantino\nFox News has issued a statement on its settlement with Dominion Voting Systems acknowledging that some of the right-wing network\u2019s on-air statements about Dominion were false.\n\u201cWe are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We acknowledge the Court\u2019s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects FOX\u2019s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,\u201d the statement said.\nFor context:\nThe statement was referring to\nJudge Eric Davis\u2019 recent ruling\nthat 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. But Fox won\u2019t have to admit on-air that it spread lies about Dominion, a Dominion representative told CNN.\nLink Copied!\nFox News-Dominion settlement totals more than $787 million, Dominion lawyer says\nFrom CNN's Nicki Brown\nDominion attorney Justin Nelson speaks during a press conference.\n(CNN)\nThe settlement between Fox News and Dominion Voting Systems totals $787,500,000, according to Dominion attorney\u00a0Justin\u00a0Nelson.\nThe settlement represents \u201cvindication and accountability,\u201d Nelson said in a news conference Tuesday afternoon.\n\u201cThe truth matters, lies have\u00a0consequences,\u201d Nelson said\n\u201cOver two years\u00a0ago, a torrent of lies swept\u00a0Dominion and election officials\u00a0across America into an\u00a0alternative universe of\u00a0conspiracy theories, causing\u00a0grievous harm,\u201d Nelson added.\nLink Copied!\nJudge praises lawyers from both sides as Fox-Dominion case ends\nFrom CNN's Marshall Cohen\nJudge Eric Davis (center) depicted earlier today in an artist sketch before finishing jury selection in the Delaware Superior Court.\n(Elizabeth Williams/AP)\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis praised both sides after they abruptly settled the defamation case between Fox News and Dominion Voting Systems at the last second.\nHe said, \u201cI have been on the bench since 2010\u2026 I think this is the best lawyering I\u2019ve had, ever.\u201d\n\u201cI would be proud to be your judge in the future,\u201d Davis said, his final words before leaving the bench.\nThe hearing is now over. The case is now over.\nLink Copied!\nJUST IN: Settlement has been reached in Fox-Dominion defamation case\nFrom CNN's Marshall Cohen\nReporters and members of the public outside of the Leonard Williams Justice Center where Dominion Voting Systems is suing Fox News in Delaware Superior Court today in Wilmington, Delaware.\n(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nA last-second settlement has been reached in Dominion Voting Systems\u2019\nhistoric defamation lawsuit\nagainst Fox News, the parties announced Tuesday in court.\n\u201cThe parties have resolved their case,\u201d Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said.\u00a0 \u201cYour presence here\u2026 was extremely important. And without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation,\u201d the judge told the jurors, before dismissing them.\nThe settlement was apparently brokered while the trial was on the brink of opening statements in Wilmington, Delaware.\nAfter swearing in the jury earlier Tuesday, an unexplained hours-long delay paused proceedings in court, which yet again triggered rampant speculation that a deal was quietly in the works.\nWhat this means:\nThe last-minute deal means the closely watched case is effectively over and won\u2019t proceed to trial. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be\nspared from testifying\nabout their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud.\nDetails of the settlement\u00a0were not immediately available and might never become public.\nMore on the case:\nIn its lawsuit, Dominion sought $1.6 billion in damages from Fox News. The right-wing network argued vociferously in pretrial proceedings that this number was inflated and\ndidn\u2019t come close\nto accurately capturing the potential losses that Dominion could have suffered as a result of Fox\u2019s 2020 broadcasts.\nFox News and Fox Corporation \u2014 its parent company, which was also a defendant \u2014 say they never defamed Dominion, and say the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. They denied Dominion\u2019s claim that they promoted these election conspiracies to save their falling ratings after the 2020 election.\nWhile the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second\nmajor defamation lawsuit\nfrom Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was smeared on Fox shows after the 2020 election. That case is still in the discovery process, and a trial isn\u2019t expected anytime soon.\nLink Copied!\nCourt back in session after unexplained delay of more than two hours\nFrom CNN's Marshall Cohen in Wilmington, Delaware\nThe Fox-Dominion trial has resumed, after an unexplained delay of more than two hours.\nLink Copied!\nFox and Dominion lawyers briefly huddle in court as delay drags on\nFrom CNN's Marshall Cohen in Wilmington, Delaware\nFox News attorney Dan Webb\u00a0(left) and Justin Nelson, attorney for Dominion Voting Systems (right), as they arrived with their legal teams outside of the Delaware Superior Court in Wilmington earlier today.\n(Eduardo Munoz/Reuters/Eric Lee/Bloomberg/Getty Images)\nThe unexplained delay in the Fox News-Dominion defamation trial has surpassed 90 minutes.\nMoments ago in court, CNN observed a top Fox lawyer showing a piece of paper \u2014presumably a note \u2014 to a top Dominion lawyer.\nA few minutes later, they both stepped out of the courtroom, into a private, secured area for court staff.

The dispute escalated after audiotapes emerged of Fox host Maria Bartiromo talking to Rudy Giuliani in 2020.\n\u201cThe investigation should include a determination whether Fox News Network, LLC and Fox Corporation complied with their discovery obligations,\u201d Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis wrote.\nThe order, which was posted on the docket earlier in the day as jury selection began in the trial, directed attorney John Elzufon to lead the inquiry. Elzufon previously served as\u00a0special\u00a0master\u00a0to handle routine evidentiary issues in the case.\nElzufon is required to finish his probe and submit a report by May 15.\nThe judge\u2019s order indicates that the\u00a0special\u00a0master\u00a0has the power to take depositions as part of his inquiry \u2013 and the\u00a0special\u00a0master\u00a0will be allowed to depose anyone he thinks is appropriate.\nFox is required to pay for all expenses related to the investigation, according to Davis\u2019 order.\nFox lawyers say they never withheld anything from Dominion, and that when new evidence emerged at a late stage, they turned it over as quickly as possible.\nLink Copied!\nFox-Dominion trial has not yet moved to opening statements after unexplained slowdown in proceedings\nFrom CNN's Marshall Cohen in Wilmington, Delaware\nA general view of the Leonard L.

Most of the 20 allegedly defamatory broadcasts mentioned in the lawsuit occurred in November and December 2020.\nThe company alleges that people at Fox News acted with actual malice and \u201crecklessly disregarded the truth\u201d when they spread this disinformation about Dominion. To prove \u201cactual malice,\u201d Dominion must convince a jury that people at Fox News who were responsible for these 20 broadcasts knew the Dominion claims were false or recklessly disregarded evidence of falsity\u00a0\u2014 but\nput them on-air\nanyway.\nAccording to Dominion\u2019s theory of the case, Fox promoted these election conspiracy theories because \u201cthe lies were good for Fox\u2019s business.\u201d Dominion\u2019s suit specifically zeroed in on shows hosted by Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Jeanine Pirro.\u00a0 Dominion said that as a result of Fox\u2019s \u201corchestrated defamatory campaign\u201d it has suffered \u201cenormous and irreparable economic harm\u201d and that its employees have been subjected to\ndeath threats and harassment\n.\nWhat is Fox\u2019s defense?\nFox said it didn\u2019t defame anyone and that the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms.\nA spokesperson for Fox has said the network \u201cis proud of our 2020 election coverage\u201d and that its coverage \u201cstands in the highest tradition of American journalism.\u201d The company said, \u201cDominion\u2019s lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished First Amendment rights.\u201d\nFox has also accused Dominion of generating \u201cnoise and confusion\u201d around the case, stating, \u201cthe core of this case remains about freedom of the press and freedom of speech, which are fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution,\u201d specifically the First Amendment.\nFox has attempted to get the lawsuit tossed. But in a major blow to the right-wing network last month, the judge overseeing the case has allowed it to go to trial. He has also\nprohibited Fox\nfrom invoking some key First Amendment defenses, finding they were without merit.\nWhat is Dominion asking for?\nDominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages. They say Fox\u2019s on-air lies destroyed its reputation and is causing election officials to cancel their Dominion contracts. CNN\nrecently reported\non the growing distrust in voting machines in heavily Republican counties.\nWhat are the trial logistics?\nThe trial is expected to last five to six weeks and will be overseen by Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric M. Davis, who was appointed to the state bench in 2012 by a Democratic governor.\u00a0A panel of 12 jurors and 12 alternates is being seated.\nCameras are not allowed in the courtroom and there will not be any video of the proceedings. There also won\u2019t be any still photography inside the courtroom.\nWho is expected to testify?\nExpected witness include Fox Corporation executives\nRupert Murdoch\nand his son Lachlan Murdoch; Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and president Jay Wallace; prominent TV hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Maria Bartiromo, Lou Dobbs, Jeanine Pirro, and Bret Baier,\namong others\n.\nDominion said it might also call Viet Dinh, Fox\u2019s chief legal officer, and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Fox board member, to the witness stand.\nBoth sides are also hoping to put on testimony from their handpicked experts who specialize in election statistics, the security of voting machines, journalism ethics, the impact of disinformation in public discourse, and more.\nRead more about the case\nhere.\nLink Copied!\nThe judge issued a flurry of pretrial rulings constraining Fox News. Here's what they said.\nFrom CNN's Marshall Cohen\nPeople arrive at the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center in Wilmington, Delaware, on April 14.\n(Eduardo Munoz/Reuters)\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis has ruled in Dominion Voting Systems\u2019 favor on key questions about Fox News\u2019 defense,\nblocking the cable network from making some First Amendment arguments\nand from bringing up certain pieces of evidence.\nThe judge ruled that Fox can\u2019t bring up broadcasts where reporters accurately fact-checked Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election in an effort to prove that other broadcasts that amplified those lies weren\u2019t defamatory.\nThose other broadcasts \u201care not relevant\u201d to the case, Davis said, because \u201cyou can\u2019t absolve yourself of defamation by putting someone else on at a different time\u201d who told the truth about Dominion.\nThe judge also ruled that Fox can\u2019t use internal Dominion emails where its staffers said their products \u201csuck\u201d and were \u201criddled with bugs,\u201d to prove that there were real concerns about Dominion machines. Those emails weren\u2019t public in 2020, so they couldn\u2019t have influenced the state of mind of Fox staffers when they promoted the Dominion claims on their shows.\nBut if Dominion wins and the case moves to damages, Fox can bring up these emails to show that Dominion might be losing business because of voting security concerns and not just because of alleged defamation.\nMeanwhile, Davis has cleared the way for Dominion to bring up Fox\u2019s financial information at the trial, including details about salaries of top hosts and executives. Fox tried to block this from the trial, arguing that salaries aren\u2019t linked to ratings, and that this data could bias the jury against the network.\n\u201cEconomics are relevant,\u201d Davis said.\nLink Copied!\nMurdoch said election lies from Giuliani and Powell\u2019s 2020 press conference were \"crazy\"\nFrom CNN's Marshall Cohen and Oliver Darcy\nDespite what appeared on air, Fox News executives and hosts privately criticized the Trump camp for pushing claims of election fraud.\nIn an email between Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation CEO Robert Thomson, Murdoch\u2019s real-time reaction to pro-Trump election deniers\nRudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell\u2019s press conference\nis captured. Murdoch controls Fox Corporation and News Corporation.\n\u201cReally crazy stuff. And damaging,\u201d Murdoch wrote in an email on November 19, 2020. Still, Giuliani and Powell returned to Fox shows promoting the same false claims.\nThe email is among the\nprivate text messages and emails that were released\nas part of Dominion Voting Systems\u2019 defamation lawsuit against Fox News.\nLink Copied!\nHere's why Dominion is suing Fox News \u2014 and how the cable network has responded\nFrom CNN's Ramishah Maruf\nThe News Corporation building in New York City, where Fox News headquarters and studios are located, seen in November 2022.\n(Anthony Behar/Sipa USA/AP/File)\nThe defamation suit brought against Fox News by Dominion Voting Systems could have significant ramifications for the right-wing cable channel.\nOpening statements\nare expected to begin soon\nin the trial, and both sides will get a chance to speak in court and present their case.\nAfter former President Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, Dominion, which is an election technology company, alleges Fox pushed various pro-Trump conspiracy theories because \u201c\nthe lies were good for Fox\u2019s business\n.\u201d The coverage included false and potentially damaging claims about the company\u2019s voting technology, according to Dominion.\nFox is arguing that it was merely reporting claims made by the Trump administration and Trump\u2019s associates. It says this case is about protecting \u201cthe rights of the free press\u201d and that a verdict in favor of Dominion would have \u201cgrave consequences\u201d for the fourth estate.\n\u201cDominion\u2019s lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished First Amendment rights,\u201d a Fox spokesperson said in a\nstatement\n.\nWhat the jury has to consider:\nDefamation cases are hard to win in the United States, because of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in New York Times v.

But the voting technology company maintains that the number hasn\u2019t changed.\n\u201cThe damages claim remains. As Fox well knows, our damages exceed $1.6 billion,\u201d a Dominion spokesperson said Monday in a statement.\nBut what has apparently changed is how Dominion will try to win those damages with the jury.\nSince Dominion sued Fox in 2021\n, the company has claimed that it sustained about $600 million in lost contracts and profits, plus an additional $1 billion in reputational damage to the company\u2019s value.\nIt now appears that Dominion will argue the entire $1.6 billion came from reputational losses, instead of partially from canceled contracts. It\u2019s unclear why Dominion is making this last-minute shift in its strategy.\nFox has aggressively pushed back on Dominion\u2019s damages claim and says the $1.6 billion figure is massively inflated. Fox lawyers have argued that Dominion can\u2019t prove the losses that it is claiming.\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a problem that a huge chunk of their lost profits is coming from business they haven\u2019t actually lost,\u201d Fox lawyer Erin Murphy said at a hearing last month.\nAs an example, Murphy pointed to a Louisiana contract where she said Dominion was \u201cclaiming lost profits on the basis of something they haven\u2019t lost.\u201d The network\u2019s court filings have cited a deposition from Dominion\u2019s CFO saying the Louisiana deal is on hold because of a competitor, not because of Fox.\nDominion\u2019s original lawsuit said, \u201cLouisiana recently cancelled its reassessment and bid process, essentially prohibiting Dominion from securing a new $100-million-plus contract.\u201d\nLink Copied!\nTucker Carlson on Trump: \"I hate him,\" his presidency was a \"disaster\"\nFrom CNN's Oliver Darcy and Marshall Cohen\nIn a private text message conversation with an unknown person, two days before the January 6 attack, Fox News host Tucker Carlson said, \u201cWe are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights.

And yet, it remains unclear whether Trump \u2013 the primary author of the corrosive conspiracies that the 2020 election was fraudulent \u2013 will end up paying a significant personal or political price.\nThe idea that Trump\u2019s claims \u2013 echoed by his aides and allies on Fox and sometimes by the channel\u2019s personalities \u2013 had any merit will not even make it to first base in the trial.

Most of the 20 allegedly defamatory broadcasts mentioned in the lawsuit occurred in November and December 2020.\nThe company alleges that people at Fox News acted with actual malice and \u201crecklessly disregarded the truth\u201d when they spread this disinformation about Dominion. To prove \u201cactual malice,\u201d Dominion must convince a jury that people at Fox News who were responsible for these 20 broadcasts knew the Dominion claims were false or recklessly disregarded evidence of falsity\u00a0\u2014 but\nput them on-air\nanyway.\nAccording to Dominion\u2019s theory of the case, Fox promoted these election conspiracy theories because \u201cthe lies were good for Fox\u2019s business.\u201d Dominion\u2019s suit specifically zeroed in on shows hosted by Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Jeanine Pirro.\u00a0 Dominion said that as a result of Fox\u2019s \u201corchestrated defamatory campaign\u201d it has suffered \u201cenormous and irreparable economic harm\u201d and that its employees have been subjected to\ndeath threats and harassment\n.\nWhat is Fox\u2019s defense?\nFox said it didn\u2019t defame anyone and that the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms.\nA spokesperson for Fox has said the network \u201cis proud of our 2020 election coverage\u201d and that its coverage \u201cstands in the highest tradition of American journalism.\u201d The company said, \u201cDominion\u2019s lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished First Amendment rights.\u201d\nFox has also accused Dominion of generating \u201cnoise and confusion\u201d around the case, stating, \u201cthe core of this case remains about freedom of the press and freedom of speech, which are fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution,\u201d specifically the First Amendment.\nFox has attempted to get the lawsuit tossed. But in a major blow to the right-wing network last month, the judge overseeing the case has allowed it to go to trial. He has also\nprohibited Fox\nfrom invoking some key First Amendment defenses, finding they were without merit.\nWhat is Dominion asking for?\nDominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages. They say Fox\u2019s on-air lies destroyed its reputation and is causing election officials to cancel their Dominion contracts. CNN\nrecently reported\non the growing distrust in voting machines in heavily Republican counties.\nWhat are the trial logistics?\nThe trial is expected to last five to six weeks and will be overseen by Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric M. Davis, who was appointed to the state bench in 2012 by a Democratic governor.\u00a0A panel of 12 jurors and 12 alternates is being seated.\nCameras are not allowed in the courtroom and there will not be any video of the proceedings.

Those emails weren\u2019t public in 2020, so they couldn\u2019t have influenced the state of mind of Fox staffers when they promoted the Dominion claims on their shows.\nBut if Dominion wins and the case moves to damages, Fox can bring up these emails to show that Dominion might be losing business because of voting security concerns and not just because of alleged defamation.\nMeanwhile, Davis has cleared the way for Dominion to bring up Fox\u2019s financial information at the trial, including details about salaries of top hosts and executives. Fox tried to block this from the trial, arguing that salaries aren\u2019t linked to ratings, and that this data could bias the jury against the network.\n\u201cEconomics are relevant,\u201d Davis said.\nLink Copied!\nMurdoch said election lies from Giuliani and Powell\u2019s 2020 press conference were \"crazy\"\nFrom CNN's Marshall Cohen and Oliver Darcy\nDespite what appeared on air, Fox News executives and hosts privately criticized the Trump camp for pushing claims of election fraud.\nIn an email between Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation CEO Robert Thomson, Murdoch\u2019s real-time reaction to pro-Trump election deniers\nRudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell\u2019s press conference\nis captured.

It says this case is about protecting \u201cthe rights of the free press\u201d and that a verdict in favor of Dominion would have \u201cgrave consequences\u201d for the fourth estate.\n\u201cDominion\u2019s lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished First Amendment rights,\u201d a Fox spokesperson said in a\nstatement\n.\nWhat the jury has to consider:\nDefamation cases are hard to win in the United States, because of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964.\nDefamation has to meet a high standard. An entity can\u2019t have just lied, it must have known (or at least strongly suspected) it was lying at the time, and it has to have been done with \u201cactual malice.\u201d\nThe court has already ruled on the first two, saying Fox aired lies and knew they were lies. So instead of a trial on the comments\u2019 veracity, the jury will be asked to consider whether Fox made the claims\nmaliciously\n.\nLimits on Fox\u2019s defense:\nThe judge has already\nrejected several of Fox\u2019s First Amendment defenses\n,\u00a0and in pretrial rulings barred the network from arguing its guests\u2019 allegedly defamatory statements were \u201cnewsworthy\u201d and deserving of coverage.\nLink Copied!\nIn preliminary instructions, judge tells jurors to focus on evidence and not let rumors influence them\nFrom CNN's Marshall Cohen and Liam Reilly\nAs the\nFox News defamation trial kicks off,\nthe judge instructed the newly sworn-in jury to avoid media coverage of the high-stakes case and focus on the evidence presented inside the courtroom.\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis told jurors they need to \u201creach a just verdict regardless of the consequences.\u201d\n\u201cDo not let rumors, suspicion, or anything else\u2026 influence you in any way,\u201d Davis added.\nHe also gave them the typical instructions for jurors \u2014 like not to watch any TV coverage about the trial.\n\u201cIf there is publicity about this trial, you must ignore and not read anything or listen to any television or radio programs about the case must decide the case,\u201d Davis said.\u00a0\u201cDuring the trial, you should keep an open mind and should not form or express any opinion about the case.\u201d\nThe jury is now on a lunch break.

But the voting technology company maintains that the number hasn\u2019t changed.\n\u201cThe damages claim remains. As Fox well knows, our damages exceed $1.6 billion,\u201d a Dominion spokesperson said Monday in a statement.\nBut what has apparently changed is how Dominion will try to win those damages with the jury.\nSince Dominion sued Fox in 2021\n, the company has claimed that it sustained about $600 million in lost contracts and profits, plus an additional $1 billion in reputational damage to the company\u2019s value.\nIt now appears that Dominion will argue the entire $1.6 billion came from reputational losses, instead of partially from canceled contracts. It\u2019s unclear why Dominion is making this last-minute shift in its strategy.\nFox has aggressively pushed back on Dominion\u2019s damages claim and says the $1.6 billion figure is massively inflated. Fox lawyers have argued that Dominion can\u2019t prove the losses that it is claiming.\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a problem that a huge chunk of their lost profits is coming from business they haven\u2019t actually lost,\u201d Fox lawyer Erin Murphy said at a hearing last month.\nAs an example, Murphy pointed to a Louisiana contract where she said Dominion was \u201cclaiming lost profits on the basis of something they haven\u2019t lost.\u201d The network\u2019s court filings have cited a deposition from Dominion\u2019s CFO saying the Louisiana deal is on hold because of a competitor, not because of Fox.\nDominion\u2019s original lawsuit said, \u201cLouisiana recently cancelled its reassessment and bid process, essentially prohibiting Dominion from securing a new $100-million-plus contract.\u201d\nLink Copied!\nTucker Carlson on Trump: \"I hate him,\" his presidency was a \"disaster\"\nFrom CNN's Oliver Darcy and Marshall Cohen\nIn a private text message conversation with an unknown person, two days before the January 6 attack, Fox News host Tucker Carlson said, \u201cWe are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights.

Fox says it never withheld any material and never lied to the court.\nIt appears that the special master\u2019s probe into a separate incident of Fox potentially withholding evidence is still underway.

And yet, it remains unclear whether Trump \u2013 the primary author of the corrosive conspiracies that the 2020 election was fraudulent \u2013 will end up paying a significant personal or political price.\nThe idea that Trump\u2019s claims \u2013 echoed by his aides and allies on Fox and sometimes by the channel\u2019s personalities \u2013 had any merit will not even make it to first base in the trial. In one remarkable development during pre-trial hearings, presiding Superior Court Judge Eric Davis ruled that jurors did not even need to decide one key issue: whether Fox\u2019s claims about Dominion were true.\n\u201cThe evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,\u201d Davis wrote, in a ruling last month that significantly narrowed the network\u2019s avenues to mount a defense.\nThe epic case now turns on an attempt by Dominion to prove the legal standard for defamation that Fox must have known (or strongly suspected) it was lying about the issues at hand at the time and that it acted with \u201cactual malice.\u201d\nKeep reading\nhere\n.\nLink Copied!\nBehind-the-scenes communications at Fox have been made public as part of the lawsuit\nFrom CNN's Ramishah Maruf\nExterior view of News Corp.

In one November 2020 exchange, Tucker Carlson said Trump\u2019s decision to snub Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration was \u201cso destructive,\u201d adding that Trump\u2019s post-election behavior was \u201cdisgusting\u201d and that he was \u201ctrying to look away.\u201d\nMurdoch emailed New York Post\u2019s Col Allan, describing Trump\u2019s election lies as \u201cbulls**t and \u201cdamaging.\u201d\nMurdoch\u2019s private messages revealed how his own thoughts contradicted what Fox espoused. \u201cMaybe Sean (Hannity) and Laura (Ingraham) went too far,\u201d Murdoch wrote in an email Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott, apparently referencing election denialism after Trump\u2019s loss to President Joe Biden.\nLink Copied!\nJudge didn't explain reasons for one-day delay of Fox News and Dominion trial\nFrom CNN's Marshall Cohen\nThis artist sketch depicts Judge Eric Davis of Delaware Superior Court on the bench Monday in Wilmington.\n(Elizabeth Williams/AP)\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis\nsaid Monday\nthat the delay in the\nFox-Dominion defamation trial\n\u201cis not unusual\u201d and told the parties that he expects them back on Tuesday to finish jury selection and start the trial.\n\u201cI made the decision to delay the start of the trial until tomorrow,\u201d Davis said in court, later adding that \u201cit\u2019s a six-week trial.

        "full_content": "Wilmington, Delaware\nCNN\n\u2014\nFox News reached a last-second settlement with Dominion Voting Systems on Tuesday as the case raced toward opening statements, paying more than $787 million to end a\ncolossal two-year legal battle\nthat publicly shredded the right-wing network\u2019s credibility.\nFox News\u2019 $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems is the largest publicly known defamation settlement in US history involving a media company.\nThe deal was announced hours after the jury was sworn in at the Delaware Superior Court. Rumors of a settlement swirled in the courthouse when, after a lunch break, the proceedings dramatically ground to a halt for nearly three hours with no explanation, while the parties apparently hammered out an accord.\nAttorneys representing Dominion Voting Systems, leave the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Del., after the defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News was settled just as the jury trial was set to begin, Tuesday, April 18, 2023.\nJulio Cortez/AP\n\u201cThe parties have resolved their case,\u201d Judge Eric Davis said, before dismissing the 12-member jury, crediting them with giving the parties an impetus to reach a settlement, effusively praising the lawyers from both sides, and gaveling out the so-called media \u201ctrial of the century\u201d before it could even begin.\nThe groundbreaking settlement \u201crepresents vindication and accountability,\u201d Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said. \u201cFor our democracy to endure for another 250 years, and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts\u2026 Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy.\u201d\nThe right-wing network said in a statement that it \u201cacknowledge[s] the Court\u2019s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,\u201d referring to\nDavis\u2019 recent ruling\nthat 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. But Fox won\u2019t have to admit on-air that it spread lies about Dominion, a Dominion representative told CNN.\nThe $787.5 million payout is roughly half of the $1.6 billion that Dominion\ninitially sought\n, though it is nearly 10 times the company\u2019s valuation from 2018, and roughly eight times its annual revenue in 2021, according to court filings.\nFox avoids painful six-week trial\nThe last-minute agreement means\nthe closely watched case\nis over and won\u2019t proceed to trial. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be\nspared from testifying\nabout their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud.\nFox lawyers leave the courthouse after Dominion Voting Systems and Fox settled a defamation lawsuit for $787.5 million, avoiding trial, over Fox's coverage of debunked election-rigging claims, in Delaware Superior Court, in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S. April 18, 2023.\nEduardo Munoz/Reuters\nThe\nwitness list\nincluded Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, his CEO son Lachlan Murdoch, and top Fox hosts like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. Damning emails, texts, and deposition testimony made public during the case revealed that these figures, and many others at Fox, privately said in 2020 that the vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. But the lies were spread on-air anyway.\nRupert Murdoch thought\nthe election denialism was \u201creally crazy,\u201d even as Fox personalities peddled those same claims to millions of viewers. Carlson said he\n\u201cpassionately\u201d hates Donald Trump\n, whose presidency was a \u201cdisaster.\u201d Fox hosts, producers, fact-checkers, and senior executives privately said in the on-air claims of a stolen election were \u201ckooky,\u201d \u201cdangerously reckless\u201d and  \u201cmind-blowingly nuts.\u201d\nThese revelations generated\nmonths\nof\nblistering\nheadlines for Fox as the case moved toward trial. By settling now, Fox deprived Dominion a chance to further expose its dishonesty with a weeks-long trial.\n\u201cThis settlement reflects Fox\u2019s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards,\u201d Fox said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cWe are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.\u201d\nFox News and Fox Corporation \u2013 its parent company, which was also a defendant \u2013 maintain they never defamed Dominion, and say the case was a meritless assault on First Amendment press freedoms.\nDramatic days in Delaware\nSpeculation of a settlement reached a fever pitch in recent days, especially after the court on Sunday announced a\none-day delay\nto the start of the trial, which was originally set to begin on Monday.\nThe\njury selection process\nwrapped up as planned Tuesday morning, and both sides prepped for opening statements. They even briefly tangled over objections to specific slides in their presentations. But when the proceedings didn\u2019t promptly resume after lunch, the chances of a deal seemed to rise by the minute, even though the top lawyers from both sides sat in the courtroom, looking at their phones, and waiting.\nThe racially diverse jury of six men and six women was brought back into the court, ready for their front-row seat to a historic trial. But Davis, the judge, instead told the panel they helped spur a settlement.\n\u201cYour presence here, short compared to what you thought, and uneventful in a certain sense, was extremely important,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWithout you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation.\u201d\nMany on the Dominion side cast the settlement as a victory for democracy and for truth itself.\n\u201cFox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,\u201d Dominion CEO John Poulos said Tuesday outside court.\nHOLLYWOOD, FLORIDA - NOVEMBER 17: Tucker Carlson speaks during 2022 FOX Nation Patriot Awards at Hard Rock Live at Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Hollywood on November 17, 2022 in Hollywood, Florida.

That case is still in the discovery process, and a trial isn\u2019t expected anytime soon.\nFor its part, Dominion still has pending lawsuits against right-wing TV networks Newsmax and OAN, as well as against Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell.

        "full_content": "CNN\n\u2014\nMillions of Americans could face massive consequences unless Speaker Kevin McCarthy can navigate out of\na debt trap\nhe has set for\nPresident Joe Biden\nthat is instead threatening to capture his House Republicans.\nThe California Republican traveled to Wall Street on Monday to deliver a fresh warning that the House GOP majority will refuse to lift a cap on government borrowing unless Biden agrees to spending cuts that would effectively neutralize his domestic agenda and neuter his White House legacy.\nMcCarthy also assured traders, however, that he would never let the US government default on its obligations \u2013 a potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger a recession and unleash job cuts by the fall in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised.\nThe United States Capitol is seen on Capitol Hill on August 6, 2022 in Washington, DC.\nAnna Rose Layden/Getty Images\nLawmakers return to Washington as debt limit crisis and other key issues loom\nThis is where the risk to Americans comes in. It\u2019s hard to see how a rookie speaker, with a tiny majority and a conference containing plenty of extremists, can engineer either of these outcomes.\nMost countries don\u2019t require the legislature to raise the government\u2019s borrowing threshold. But the quirky situation in the US has made a once routine duty an opportunity for political mischief in a polarized age. Since the government spends more than it makes in revenue, it must borrow money to service its debt and pay for spending that Congress has already authorized. It has no problem getting more credit since the US pays its bills and has always had a stellar credit rating, despite one previous downgrade from the threat of default.\nAt least, that\u2019s the way it has worked until now.\nMcCarthy beseeched his conference in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to line up behind a bill that would raise the debt limit for a year but require a flurry of spending concessions from Biden. He styled the measure as an initial way of forcing the president to the negotiating table. But the bill is purely tactical since it\u2019s got no chance of passing the Democratic-led Senate.\nBut in a sign of how difficult it will be for the speaker to even pull this gambit off, there were signs of internal disagreement on what should be in the package among GOP members.\nRep. Scott Perry, the chairman of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, was frustrated about a lack of specificity in the plan and wanted steeper cuts.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the package completely. That\u2019s the issue,\u201d Perry told reporters. Some members seem reluctant to commit so far. Conservative Rep. Tim Burchett told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, \u201cI\u2019m open to it but I\u2019m still a \u2018no\u2019 vote.\u201d\nIt is not unusual for various factions in a congressional majority to haggle over details before a final package is agreed. And House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry, a McCarthy ally, was confident the plan would pass the House. \u201cThe question is, what does the White House then do once we pass this package? We\u2019ve clearly stated there is no clean debt ceiling that will pass the House,\u201d he added. \u201cSo we\u2019ll have the first opening offer here. And we\u2019ll see if the president\u2019s willing to come to the table and negotiate like previous presidents have.\u201d\nMcHenry\u2019s comment, however, reflected a big flaw in the GOP strategy since it relies on McCarthy\u2019s belief that Biden will have no choice but to come to the table. The White House has insisted the House should do its job and pass a simple bill that only raises the borrowing limit\nIn effect, McCarthy has already set up a severe test of his leadership since there\u2019s no guarantee that he can pass the measure in a House where he can only lose four votes and in which there are few signs the fractious GOP can agree on what programs to cut and by how much. And even if the measure does squeeze through the House in the coming weeks, it will likely be an idealized Republican product on which Biden and the Democratic Senate will never bite. Any subsequent package that emerged would almost certainly feature concessions that could splinter its GOP support.\nStill, the speaker was typically bullish when he predicted Monday he\u2019d have the votes to pass his initial bill.\n\u201cI think we got 218 to raise the debt ceiling,\u201d McCarthy told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of consensus within the conference. We\u2019ll get together and work through it.\u201d\nThe US Capitol.\nArturo Jimenez/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\nHouse Republicans in talks over one-year debt ceiling plan in push to challenge White House\nHis assurances may not be very reassuring, however, because his similarly blithe predictions that he had the votes to win the speakership in January degenerated into a\nfarcical process\nthat saw him make huge concessions to his party\u2019s most radical members and required 15 ballots before he finally won the job of his dreams.\nBut with the debt ceiling, it will be Americans\u2019 livelihoods and the global economy, rather than McCarthy\u2019s immediate political ambitions, that are on the line.\nRepublicans are yet to agree on their own demands\nSo far, Republicans seem to be having trouble negotiating with themselves, let alone Biden. Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, who is helping to fashion the GOP\u2019s position, said that while the party hopes to pass the initial bill next week, challenges remain.\n\u201cI think the hardest part is just that there are an unlimited number of conservative policy victories that, of course, we all want to see worked in,\u201d Johnson told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. \u201cThe reality is that in a negotiation, you never get everything you want. And so I think our biggest issue right now is how do we squeeze these thousands of desires down to a manageable and credible number of asks?\u201d\nLeft: Rep. Jim Jordan speaks during a news conference at the Capitol on November 17, 2022 in Washington, DC. Right: Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg speaks during a press conference following the arraignment of former President Donald Trump April 4, 2023 in New York City.\nGetty Images\nHouse GOP escalates defense of Trump with New York field hearing seeking to discredit Manhattan DA\nAnother complication is that some members of the Republican conference have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling on principle \u2013 no matter what. In a powerful Republican majority such holdouts could be ignored. In McCarthy\u2019s narrow majority \u2013 secured after a 2022 midterm election that fell short of GOP expectations \u2013 they have real leverage. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since they\u2019d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill. And the speaker probably couldn\u2019t risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule, as he battled to win his job, that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster.\nThe coming showdown over the debt ceiling is potentially the defining moment in the two-year period of uneasy cohabitation between the Democratic president and Republican speaker. Neither Biden nor McCarthy can afford to lose, and the outcome will shape both their legacies.\nRepublicans may have less leverage than they think\nThere is nothing wrong with Republicans seeking to use the leverage they won in a democratic election to try to further their political goals of cutting public spending. There are some GOP lawmakers who sincerely worry about debt and deficits \u2013 even when their party runs government. Plenty of economists worry about the always ballooning national debt, which has crashed through $31 trillion. And Biden\u2019s big spending on Covid relief packages, infrastructure, climate mitigation measures and health care programs triggered a debate on whether he worsened the inflation crisis.\nBut are Republicans choosing the right hill for this battle when jobs, market-linked pension plans and the economic well-being of millions are at risk? The absolutist nature of McCarthy\u2019s position pays little heed to a delicate balance of power. Democrats control the White House and the Senate, so in handing Republicans the House, albeit barely, voters might have been seeking compromise rather than confrontation.\nRepublicans are also facing claims of hypocrisy, since they had little problem raising the debt limit when Donald Trump, who rarely worried about making a big spending splash, was president. The 45th commander in chief is also on videotape dating to his White House days saying he couldn\u2019t believe anyone would use the debt ceiling as a \u201cnegotiating wedge.\u201d Republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when Democrats are in office but often look the other way when there is one of their own in the Oval Office.\nMcCarthy needs to reverse the blame equation\nIn order to prevail in this fight, McCarthy has to somehow change the political dynamic by saddling Biden with the blame for any default and the economic tensions that could begin to unfold even before the country plunges over a fiscal cliff.\nHe tried to do so on Monday by insisting that the biggest threat to the US economy wasn\u2019t a default but rising national debt.\n\u201cWithout exaggeration American debt is a ticking time bomb that will detonate unless we take serious responsible action. Yet, how has President Biden reacted to this issue? He has done nothing. So in my view, and I think the rest of America, it\u2019s irresponsible,\u201d he said.\nPrevious fiscal showdowns between GOP-controlled Congresses and Democratic presidents have often rebounded poorly on Republicans. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, for example, branded their foes in the House as economic arsonists and thereby gained political traction.\nMcCarthy needs to reverse the equation, which is why he\u2019s trying to portray Biden as stubborn in refusing to negotiate concessions for raising the debt ceiling. The two men haven\u2019t met for the last 75 days and the White House is sticking to its position that the place for talks is over a budget \u2013 which House Republicans are yet to produce \u2013 and not with the full faith and credit of the US government on the line and with America\u2019s reputation as a financial haven at stake.\nMcCarthy is, therefore, in a bind. Congress, not the president, has the power to raise the government\u2019s borrowing limit. Yet the speaker is demanding Biden give away his store over a duty that only McCarthy and his lawmakers can fulfill. No one would benefit from a default \u2013 especially not a president likely heading into a reelection race. But it\u2019s hard to see how McCarthy can emerge from this conundrum as the winner if he triggers an economic meltdown.\nThe White House twisted that particular knife on Monday.\n\u201cThere is one responsible solution to the debt limit: addressing it promptly, without brinksmanship or hostage taking \u2013 as Republicans did three times in the last administration and as Presidents Trump and Reagan argued for in office,\u201d spokesman Andrew Bates said.\nRepublicans in the Senate have so far tried to avoid the mess. But Senate Republican leader\nMitch McConnell\ndid at least give his colleague in the House some moral support on Monday when he returned to the Capitol after convalescing after a fall.\n\u201cPresident Biden does not get to stick his fingers in his ears and refuse to listen, talk or negotiate. And the American people know that. The White House needs to stop wasting time and start negotiating with the Speaker of the House,\u201d McConnell said, though notably didn\u2019t volunteer to get involved.\nMcCarthy\u2019s speech on Monday only furthered the impression that a damaging political crisis over the debt ceiling is, after months of simmering, moving toward a boil.\nAs Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York put it on Monday: \u201cHe went all the way to Wall Street and gave us no more details, no more facts, no new information, and I\u2019ll be blunt: If Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction we are headed to default.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Melanie Zanona, Morgan Rimmer, Haley Talbot and Lauren Fox contributed to this report.",

CNN has reached out to prosecutors to confirm the information.\nLester\nturned himself in at a detention center\nTuesday then hours later was released on bail. The conditions of his $200,000 bond prohibit him from having any type of weapon and cannot have direct or indirect contact with Yarl or his family, according to Clay County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesperson Sarah Boyd.\nRalph, 16, was shot in the head and arm after he went to the wrong address to pick up his siblings. He has been\nreleased from a hospital\nbut faces an arduous road to recovery, his family said.\nLester has told police he and the teen did not exchange words before he fired at him through a locked glass door.\nThis booking photo of Andrew Lester was taken after he turned himself in to authorities Tuesday.\nClay County, Missouri, Sheriff's Office\nCNN has not been able to reach the homeowner. CNN has yet to determine whether Lester has an attorney.\nThe criminal charges have brought a bit of comfort to Ralph\u2019s family \u2013 but long roads lie ahead, both with Ralph\u2019s recovery and the quest for justice, his aunt Faith Spoonmore told CNN.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as turning a page,\u201d Spoonmore said Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a little better that he is \u2013 hopefully \u2013 going to get part of what of he deserves.\u201d\nBut questions remain over why Lester was initially detained but released a few hours after the April 13 shooting.\n\u201cI share the outrage and concern of many in asking why,\u201d Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told CNN.\n\u201cIn Missouri, you can have a 24-hour hold. It is clear here that this was two or three hours, where they questioned the suspect. He was able to go back home that evening.\u201d\nLester told police he fired immediately after answering the doorbell when he saw Ralph pulling on an exterior door handle, according to the probable cause document obtained by CNN.\nLester thought Ralph was trying to break in to the home and was \u201cscared to death\u201d due to the boy\u2019s size, according to the document.\nRalph Yarl\nFrom Instagram\nOfficers responded just before 10 p.m. that night after receiving reports of a shooting. When they arrived, they found Ralph wounded in the street.\nThe shooting left Ralph, who plays bass clarinet and is a band leader in school, with gunshot wounds to his head and arm. While he was hospitalized, Ralph told police he did not pull on the door, according to the document.\nIt was \u201cnothing short of a miracle\u201d that Ralph was discharged from the hospital, his attorney Ben Crump told CNN on Monday. But \u201che\u2019s not out of the woods yet.\u201d\nThe shooting fueled protests in Kansas City and stirred memories of\nTrayvon Martin\nand\nAhmaud Arbery\n\u2013 young Black males who were shot and killed by men who later claimed self-defense.\nDemonstrators have marched through Kansas City chanting, \u201cJustice for Ralph,\u201d and calling for the shooter\u2019s arrest.\nThe shooting also came days before\na 20-year-old woman was shot and killed\nin upstate New York after she and three others accidentally turned into the wrong driveway.\nThis image from a GoFundMe page shows Kaylin Gillis. A 20-year-old woman was fatally shot Saturday night after she and three other people accidentally turned into the wrong driveway in Hebron, a rural town in upstate New York, according to Washington County Sheriff Jeffrey Murphy.\nFrom gofundme/Kaylin Gillis\nA 20-year-old woman was shot and killed after accidentally turning into the wrong driveway in upstate New York, officials say\nWhile Ralph\u2019s attorneys say the teen never posed a threat to his shooter, it remains unclear whether Missouri\u2019s \u201cstand your ground\u201d law will be cited in Lester\u2019s defense case.\n\u201c\nStand your ground\n\u201d laws allow people to respond to threats or force without fear of criminal prosecution in any place where a person has the right to be.\nRalph\u2019s aunt challenged the notion that her nephew\u2019s \u201csize\u201d could be a threat.\n\u201cI really don\u2019t understand how,\u201d Spoonmore said. \u201cI doubt Ralph is even 170 pounds. Ralph is not even 6 feet (tall).\u201d\nShe said she\u2019s on a mission to help get justice for her nephew.\n\u201cI want justice to look the same across the board,\u201d Spoonmore said. \u201cI want justice to look the same.\u201d\n\u2018A racial component to this case\u2019\nThe mayor said he believes Ralph was racially profiled by the shooter.\n\u201cThis boy was shot because he was existing while Black,\u201d Lucas said.\nClay County Prosecuting Attorney Zachary Thompson has said, \u201cThere was a racial component to this case,\u201d but did not elaborate.\nOn the night of the shooting, Lester was taken into custody and was released less than two hours later, two representatives at the Kansas City Police Department detention unit previously told CNN.\nLester was released because police recognized that more investigative work needed to be done, Thompson said.\nAttorney Crump questioned why Lester was not detained longer.\n\u201cNobody can tell us if the roles were reversed, and you had a Black man shoot a White 16-year-old teenager for merely ringing his doorbell that he would not be arrested. I mean, this citizen went home and slept in his bed at night after shooting that young Black kid in the head,\u201d Crump told CNN.\n\u201cHe merely rang the doorbell. That was it,\u201d the teen\u2019s attorney said. \u201cAnd the owner of the home shoots through the door, hitting him in the head and then shoots him a second time.\u201d\nThe mayor said he didn\u2019t even know the details of the case until several days after the shooting. And while he believes race played a role in the shooting, he acknowledged the work by police \u2013 including White officers \u2013 who helped prosecutors file charges against Lester.\n\u201cWe did have officers, White officers for what it\u2019s worth, who did a lot of hard work to get this case file to the prosecutor having charges filed shortly thereafter,\u201d Lucas said.\n\u201cThat being said, to pretend that race is not a part of this whole situation would be to have your head in the sand.\u201d\nHow the shooting unfolded\nBefore the shooting, Lester was lying down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring and picked up his .32 caliber revolver, he told police, according to a probable cause statement.\nHe then went to his home\u2019s front entrance, which includes an interior door and a glass exterior door \u2013 both of which were locked.\nA police vehicle is seen Monday outside the house where 16-year-old Ralph Yarl was shot.\nCharlie Riedel/AP\nLester opened the interior door and \u201csaw a black male approximately 6 feet tall pulling on the exterior storm door handle,\u201d Lester told police.\n\u201cHe stated he believed someone was attempting to break into the house, and shot twice within a few seconds of opening the door,\u201d the probable cause statement reads.\n\u201cHe believed he was protecting himself from a physical confrontation and could not take the chance of the male coming in,\u201d the document reads.\nLester said he immediately called 911 after the shooting, according to the document.\nProtesters march Sunday in Kansas City.\nSusan Pfannmuller/AP\nPolice spoke with Ralph while he was being treated at a hospital, where he told them his mother asked him to pick up his brothers at 1100 NE 115th Street, according to the document, which notes the actual address they were staying at was 1100 NE 115th Terrace.\nWhen he arrived at the house on 115th Street, Ralph said he rang the doorbell and waited a while before a man eventually opened the door and immediately shot him in the head, causing him to fall, the document says.\nWhile the teenager was still on the ground, the man then fired again, shooting him in the arm, Ralph told police.\nRalph said he got up and ran to keep from being shot, and he heard the man say, \u201cDon\u2019t come around here,\u201d the document says.

A major takeaway of the new study is that misuse and sharing of stimulant prescription medications is happening in middle and high schools, not just college,\u201d said Camenga, who was not involved with the study.\nWide range of abuse\nPublished Tuesday in the journal\nJAMA Network Open\n, the study analyzed data collected between 2005 and 2020 by Monitoring the Future, a federal survey that has measured drug and alcohol use among secondary school students nationwide each year since 1975.\nIn the data set used for this study, questionnaires were given to more than 230,000 teens in eighth, 10th and 12th grades in a nationally representative sample of 3,284 secondary schools.\nAdderall pills\nAlex DiStasi/Adobe Stock\nAdderall users struggle with ongoing shortage while reason -- and resolution -- remain uncertain\nSchools with the highest rates of\nteens using prescribed ADHD medications\nwere about 36% more likely to have students misusing prescription stimulants during the past year, the study found. Schools with few to no students currently using such treatments had much less of an issue, but it didn\u2019t disappear, McCabe said.\n\u201cWe know that the two biggest sources are leftover medications, perhaps from family members such as siblings, and asking peers, who may attend other schools,\u201d he said.\nSchools in the suburbs in all regions of the United States except the Northeast had higher rates of teen misuse of ADHD medications, as did schools where typically one or more parent had a college degree, according to the study.\nSchools with more White students and those who had medium levels of student binge drinking were also more likely to see teen abuse of stimulants.\nOn an individual level, students who said they had used marijuana in the past 30 days were four times as likely to abuse ADHD medications than teens who did not use weed, according to the analysis.\nIn addition, adolescents who said they used ADHD medications currently or in the past were about 2.5% more likely to have misused the stimulants when compared with\npeers who had never used stimulants, the study found.\n\u201cBut these findings were not being driven solely by teens with ADHD misusing their medications,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cWe still found a significant association, even when we excluded students who were never prescribed ADHD therapy.\u201d\nData collection for the study was through 2020. Since then,\nnew statistics\nshow prescriptions for stimulants surged 10% during 2021 across most age groups.  At the same time, there has been a nationwide shortage of Adderall, one of the most popular ADHD drugs, leaving many patients\nunable to fill or refill their prescriptions.\nDangers of misuse\nThe stakes are high: Taking stimulant medications improperly over time can result in stimulant use disorder, which can lead to anxiety, depression, psychosis and seizures, experts say.\nCavan Images/Getty Images\nThe benefits of 'body doubling' when you have ADHD, according to experts\nIf overused or combined with alcohol or other drugs, there can be sudden health consequences. Side effects can include \u201cparanoia, dangerously high body temperatures, and an irregular heartbeat, especially if stimulants are taken in large doses or in ways other than swallowing a pill,\u201d according to the\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\n.\nResearch has also shown people who misuse ADHD medications are highly likely to have\nmultiple substance use disorders\n.\nAbuse of stimulant drugs has grown over the past two decades, experts say, as more adolescents are\ndiagnosed and prescribed\nthose medications \u2014 studies have\nshown 1 in every 9 high school seniors report taking stimulant therapy for ADHD, McCabe said.\nFor children with ADHD who use their medications appropriately, stimulants can be effective treatment. They are \u201cprotective for the health of a child,\u201d Camenga said. \u201cThose adolescents diagnosed and treated correctly and monitored do very well \u2014 they have a lower risk of new mental health problems or new substance use disorders.\u201d\nWhat parents and caregivers can do\nThe solution to the problem of stimulant misuse among middle and high school teens isn\u2019t to limit use of the medications for the children who really need them, McCabe stressed.\nParents should use a lockbox, count pills and stay on top of early prescription refills, experts say.\nTassii/E+/Getty Images\n\u201cInstead, we need to look very long and hard at school strategies that are more or less effective in curbing stimulant medication misuse,\u201d he said. \u201cParents can make sure the schools their kids  attend have safe storage for medication and strict dispensing policies. And ask about prevalence of misuse \u2014 that data is available for every school.\u201d\nFamilies can also help by talking to their children about how to handle peers who approach them wanting a pill or two to party or pull an all-night study session, he added.\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many kids do not know what to say,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cParents can role-play with their kids to give them options on what to say so they are ready when it happens.\u201d\nParents and guardians\nshould always store controlled medications in a lockbox, and should not be afraid to count pills and stay on top of early refills, he added.\n\u201cFinally, if parents suspect any type of misuse, they should contact their child\u2019s prescriber right away,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cThat child should be screened and assessed immediately.\u201d",

        "full_content": "CNN\n\u2014\nSenate Democrats railed against Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday amid reports that the Supreme Court conservative\nfailed to disclose\nluxury travel, gifts and a real estate transaction involving a GOP megadonor, but their plan to investigate the conservative jurist remains unclear.\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin has promised that his committee will hold a hearing on the alleged ethics violations in the coming weeks, but shared no details when pressed by CNN on whether lawmakers will seek testimony from Thomas or others who might have knowledge about his relationship with the donor, Texas-based billionaire Harlan Crow.\nSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas attends the ceremonial swearing-in ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett on the South Lawn of the White House October 26, 2020 in Washington, DC.\nTasos Katopodis/Getty Images/File\nClarence Thomas to amend financial disclosure forms to reflect sale to GOP megadonor\nAsked if subpoenas were on the table, Durbin said that no decision has been made on that yet. He said that it was \u201ctoo soon\u201d to share more information about what his committee\u2019s hearing on Supreme Court ethics might look like. He and other Judiciary Democrats sent a letter to Chief Justice John Roberts last week calling for him to open an investigation into the Thomas allegations.\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Tuesday that \u201cthe American people deserve all of the facts surrounding Justice Thomas\u2019s blatant violation of law.\u201d\n\u201cI hope that [Thomas] will voluntarily appear, and if not, we should consider subpoenas for him and others, like Harlan Crow, who have information,\u201d Blumenthal said.\nOther Democrats on the committee said Tuesday that they were deferring to Durbin, who huddled with Democrats on Monday evening to discuss their strategy towards Thomas.\nMeanwhile, Republicans appear mostly united in defending the Thomas, suggesting the court can handle its own affairs.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attacked Democrats for criticizing the court, and said he has confidence in Roberts \u201cto deal with these court internal issues.\u201d\n\u201cThe Democrats, it seems to me, spent a lot of time criticizing individual members of the court and going after the court as an institution,\u201d McConnell told reporters Tuesday.\nBringing more transparency to the high court has had some bipartisan support in the past, but the court\u2019s jerk to the right \u2013 particularly with the three justices that former President Donald Trump put on the bench \u2013 has raised the partisan stakes around the issue. In recent years, the conservative majority has handled pivotal rulings undoing abortions rights, dismantling gun regulations and reining in the powers of executive branch agencies \u2013 all prompting outcry from Democrats.\nEven as Senate Democrats have yet to settle on a plan for their own response to the Thomas allegations, they sought to highlight the issue and framed it within their broader push for a code-of-ethics for the Supreme Court, which is excluded from many of the ethics rules that apply to lower rungs of the federal judiciary.\n\u201cI\u2019m disturbed by the recent reports detailing potentially unethical \u2013 even potentially illegal conduct \u2013 at the highest levels of our judiciary,\u201d Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat, said at a Judiciary Committee hearing for three lower court nominees on Tuesday. \u201cIt should go without saying that judges at all levels should be held to strict and enforceable ethical standards.\u201d\nDurbin said in a speech that Congress shouldn\u2019t have to wait for the court to act.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court doesn\u2019t need to wait on Congress to clean up its act; the justices could take action today if they wanted to, and if the court fails to act, Congress must,\u201d Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said on the Senate floor Tuesday.\nBack-to back-reports in ProPublica this month detailed how luxury travel and gifts to Thomas from Crow \u2013 and even a real estate transaction \u2013 went unreported in Thomas\u2019 annual financial disclosures.\nThomas has said that the travel and gifts to him and his family that were financed by the Crows went unreported because he had been advised that he was not required to do so, under an exemption in the court\u2019s disclosure rules for so-called \u201cpersonal hospitality.\u201d After scrutiny of those rules by lawmakers, the Judicial Conference \u2013 which operates as the policy-making body for the federal judiciary \u2013 recently closed a loophole in those rules that appears to have covered some of the hospitality Thomas received. Thomas said that he intended to follow that updated guidance in the future, and a source close to the justice also told CNN in recent days that he planned to amend his disclosure form to report the real estate transaction, the sale of his mother\u2019s home to Crow.\n\u201cIf the reports are accurate, it stinks,\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney said Monday evening, in rare comments from a Republican criticizing Thomas\u2019 lack of transparency.\nRepublicans defend Thomas and say SCOTUS can address ethics internally\nOther Republicans lined up in defense of the justice \u2013 who was named to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Bush in 1991 \u2013 and said it wasn\u2019t Congress\u2019 place to push an ethics code on the high court.\nWASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 15: U.S. Sen.

Josh Hawley, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, suggested that the accusations against Thomas were part of a \u201cmulti-decade effort now to target Clarence Thomas by these liberal activist groups.\u201d\nThis is not the first time Thomas has been at the center of an ethics controversy. Last year, CNN reported that his wife Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist, was texting with Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about the former president\u2019s efforts overturn his 2020 election defeat, and her political lobbying has long raised questions about when justices are obligated to recuse themselves from cases.\nYet Republicans have shown little interest in joining Democrats in using legislation to impose an ethics code on the justices.\n\u201cThe Court, kind of historically I think, has sort of policed itself,\u201d said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the GOP\u2019s Senate Whip, who said Thomas had been a \u201csolid justice on the court through the years and has acquitted himself well there.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what the court does,\u201d South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, told CNN Tuesday. \u201cI prefer them to do it internally.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Lauren Fox, Ted Barrett, Ali Zaslav, Nicky Robertson, Morgan Rimmer and Ariane de Vogue contributed to this report.",

I followed orders with this hand and killed children,\u201d Uldarov said, describing his motivation for the interview.\nThe Wagner Group is a Russian private mercenary organization fighting in Ukraine, headed by Russian oligarch\nYevgeny Prigozhin\n.\nIt has\nrecruited tens of thousands of fighters\nfrom Russian jails,\noffering freedom and cash\nafter a six-month tour. It\u2019s estimated by Western intelligence officials and prison advocacy groups that between 40,000 and 50,000 men were recruited.\nUldarov said in the eastern Ukrainian cities of\nSoledar\nand Bakhmut \u2013 which have seen some of the\nfiercest fighting\n\u2013 Wagner mercenaries \u201cwere given the command to annihilate everyone.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a superior over all the commanders \u2013 it\u2019s Prigozhin, who told us not to let anyone get out of there and annihilate everyone,\u201d he added. CNN has\npreviously reported\non former Wagner fighters making similar claims.\nUldarov has since appeared to\nrecant his account\nin a video call with Prigozhin-linked Russian news agency RIA-FAN.\nAt one point in the interview, Savichev described how they \u201cgot the order to execute any men who were 15 years or older.\u201d\nHe also talked about getting orders to \u2018sweep\u2019 a house. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether there is a civilian there or not. The house needs to be swept. I didn\u2019t give a f**k who was inside,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhether a hut or a house, the point was to make sure that there wasn\u2019t a single living person left inside,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can condemn me for this.

This is a flagrant lie. These people (spreading the lies) are our enemies, and we will deal with them in a special way.\u201d\nEarlier, Prigozhin said on Telegram: \u201cRegarding the execution of children, of course, no one ever shoots civilians or children, absolutely no one needs this. We came there to save them from the regime they were under.\u201d\nAndriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president\u2019s office, said in a tweet Monday that the group must be held accountable.\n\u201cRussian terrorists confessed to numerous murders of Ukrainian children in Bakhmut and Soledar. Confession is not enough. There must be a punishment. Tough and fair. And it will definitely be. How many more crimes like these have been committed?\u201d he said.\nIn February, CNN\nspoke to two former Wagner fighters\nwho described how recruited Wagner convicts are pushed to the front lines in a human wave, reminiscent of World War I charges.

Ben Cardin of Maryland and aims to set up a floor vote on the issue this afternoon, which Republicans are expected to block.",
        "full_content": "CNN\n\u2014\nRepublicans on Tuesday formally blocked a request from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to temporarily replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee, something Democrats hoped to do in order to advance stalled judicial nominations.\nSenate Democrats are seeking to temporarily replace Feinstein on the powerful panel that processes judicial nominees as the California Democrat remains absent, recovering from shingles.\nSenate Republicans, however, have made clear that they have been prepared to block Democratic efforts to replace Feinstein on the committee, ratcheting up pressure on the 89-year-old California Democrat to resign or return quickly.\nFeinstein\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s return date is still unclear and she\nasked just last week\nto be \u201a\u00c4\u00fatemporarily\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 replaced on the committee as she recovers.\nSchumer introduced his motion on Tuesday by talking about his friendship with Feinstein, and highlighting her accomplishments.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faToday, I am acting not just as Leader but as Dianne\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s friend, in honoring her wishes, until she returns to the Senate,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Schumer said.\nGOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, objected to Schumer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s request, though he also praised the California Democrat. He argued that Schumer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s move is to get more judges confirmed.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faShe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a dear friend and we hope for her speedy recovery and return back to the Senate. With all due respect, my colleague, Senator Schumer, this is about a handful of judges that you can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t get the votes for,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Graham said.\nDemocrats could still force a vote to replace the Feinstein, but that would require the support of 10 Republicans and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unlikely they would use a lot of valuable floor time for something with little chance of success.\nFeinstein, who has already announced she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not seeking reelection, initially said she expected to return to Washington \u201a\u00c4\u00faby the end of the March work period,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but that her return got \u201a\u00c4\u00fadelayed due to continued complications related to my diagnosis.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nShe recently said she plans to return \u201a\u00c4\u00faas soon as possible once my medical team advises that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s safe for me to travel.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nCardin told CNN Tuesday he had discussed with Schumer being the temporary replacement on the committee but that he had not discussed the decision with Feinstein.\nThe Maryland Democrat said he and Feinstein have not spoken since she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been out of the Senate and that it is his understanding that this is only a temporary move until she returns.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI recognize the importance of the numbers on the committee, and this way we can be able to conduct business. I look at this as a way of dealing with a current situation,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Cardin said.\nDemocrats\nwould need 60 votes to replace Feinstein\non the panel, but senior Republicans in leadership and on the committee made clear Monday that they would not give them the votes to do that. If Feinstein does not return soon, at least 12 nominees, or possibly even more, could be stalled.\nIf Democrats are unable to replace Feinstein or if she does not return to Washington soon, they could see key agenda items thwarted \u201a\u00c4\u00ec both on the committee and on the Senate floor.\nAsked if the California Democrat should consider resigning if she can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t return by May, Schumer responded that he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00fahopeful\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she will return \u201a\u00c4\u00favery soon.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faLook, I spoke to Senator Feinstein just a few days ago and she and I are both very hopeful that she will return very soon,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Schumer said at his weekly policy press conference in the US Capitol.\nFeinstein announced in February that she\nwould not run for reelection,\nand a number of Democrats have already launched campaigns for her seat in 2024 in what is shaping up to be a competitive primary.\nMany congressional Democrats have remained largely supportive of her decision to remain in office while absent from the Capitol as she recovers from shingles.\nBut Feinstein has faced calls to resign from two House Democrats \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and if Democrats are not able to replace her on the committee, that number could start to grow.\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin\nrecently acknowledged to CNN\nthat Feinstein\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s absence had slowed down the party\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s push to confirm nominees. But Durbin has stopped short of calling on Feinstein to resign, saying he hopes that Republicans will help to temporarily replace her on the committee and recognize that \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe rain can fall on both sides of the road.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nAsked if her absence has longer ramifications for the Democrats\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 ability to confirm nominees, the Illinois Democrat said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faYes, of course it does,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 pointing to the long process of getting nominees scheduled for votes during precious floor time.\nRepublican Sen. John Cornyn, a senior member on the Judiciary Committee and close adviser to McConnell, told CNN that he opposes the effort to replace Feinstein on the panel.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think Republicans can or should help President Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most controversial nominees,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the Texas Republican said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI support having Sen. Feinstein come back as soon as she can. But this effort to confirm controversial and in many instances largely unqualified nominees, I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think you can expect any Republican cooperation.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nCNN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Manu Raju and Alayna Treene contributed.",

He also said he would ask the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation to look into the case.\nMcCurtain County is in southeastern Oklahoma, about 200 miles from Oklahoma City.\nThe recording was made hours after Gazette-News reporter Chris Willingham filed a lawsuit against the sheriff\u2019s office, Manning and the Board of County Commissioners, alleging they had defamed him and violated his civil rights, the newspaper reported.\nIn the recording, Manning spoke of needing to go near the newspaper\u2019s office and expressed concern about what would happen if she ran into Willingham, the\nOklahoman\nreported, citing additional reporting from the Gazette-News.\nAccording to the Oklahoman report, Jennings said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re talking about you can\u2019t control yourself?\u201d and Manning replied: \u201cYeah, I ain\u2019t worried about what he\u2019s gonna do to me.

CNN has reached out to all four county officials for comment.\nThe Oklahoma Sheriffs\u2019 Association voted Tuesday to suspend the membership of Clardy, Manning and Hendrix, the group\u2019s executive director told CNN.\nState and local agencies investigating\nWillingham and his father, Bruce Willingham, the paper\u2019s publisher, have been advised to temporarily leave town,\nCNN affiliate KJRH\nreported.\n\u201cFor nearly a year, they have suffered intimidation, ridicule and harassment based solely on their efforts to report the news for McCurtain County,\u201d Kilpatrick Townsend, the law firm representing the Willingham family, told CNN in a statement.\nThe McCurtain County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a\nstatement\nMonday that there is an \u201congoing investigation into multiple significant violations\u201d of the Oklahoma Security of Communications Act, which makes it \u201cillegal to secretly record a conversation in which you are not involved and do not have the consent of at least one of the involved parties.\u201d It also said the recording has yet to be \u201cduly authenticated or validated.\u201d\n\u201cOur preliminary information indicates that the media released audio recording has, in fact, been altered.

The plant has frequently been disconnected from Ukraine\u2019s power grid due to intense Russian shelling in the area, raising fears across Europe of a nuclear accident.\nWhile the plant is still physically operated by Ukrainian staff, Rosatom manages it. The Energy Department warned Rosatom in the letter that it is \u201cunlawful\u201d for any Russian citizens or entities to handle the US technology.\nCNN has reached out to Rosatom for comment.\nVideo Ad Feedback\nSatellite images show changes Russia are making to occupied nuclear plant\n03:36\n- Source:\nCNN\n\u201cIt is unlawful under United States law for non-authorized persons, including, but not limited to, Russian citizens and Russian entities,\u201d the letter says, \u201csuch as Rosatom and its subsidiaries, to knowingly and willfully access, possess, control, export, store, seize, review, re-export, ship, transfer, copy, manipulate such technology or technical data, or direct, or authorize others to do the same, without such Russian entities becoming authorized recipients by the Secretary of the US Department of Energy.\u201d\nIt is not clear whether Rosatom has responded to the letter. The Energy Department\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration told CNN in a statement that the letter is authentic.\nThe letters were first reported by the news outlet RBC Ukraine.\n\u201cThe Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration can confirm that the letter is legitimate,\u201d said Shayela Hassan, the deputy director of public affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration.\nShe added: \u201cThe Secretary of Energy has the statutory responsibility for authorizing the transfer of unclassified civilian nuclear technology and assistance to foreign atomic energy activities. DOE does not comment on regulatory activities.\u201d\nAnother letter from Ferkile to the Energy Department\u2019s Inspector General, reviewed by CNN and dated October 24, 2022, outlines the technology the US has exported to Ukraine for use in the Zaporizhzhia plant and reiterates that the department has \u201cno record of any current authorization to transfer this technology and technical data to any Russian national or entity.\u201d\nThe Energy Department\u2019s Office of Nuclear Energy has been public about the US\u2019 support for the plant, and stated on its website in June 2021 that \u201cthe United States helped implement new maintenance procedures and operations at the reactor that should ultimately strengthen energy security\u201d in Ukraine.\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misattributed the news outlet that first reported the letters. It was RBC Ukraine.",

        "full_content": "CNN\n\u2014\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration\namended\nthe terms of its emergency use authorizations for the Pfizer and Moderna bivalent vaccines on Tuesday, allowing people ages 65 and older and certain people with weakened immunity to get additional doses before this fall\u2019s vaccination campaigns.\nThe bivalent vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna carry instructions for fighting both the original strain of the Covid-19 virus as well as Omicron and its spinoffs.\nThey have been available in the United States\nsince September\nunder emergency use authorizations, or EUAs, which tightly restrict how the vaccines may be given.\nOn Tuesday, the FDA changed the terms of the authorizations for those vaccines so that certain individuals could get an additional dose ahead of most others.\nYoung Female doctor in protective mask injecting or prepairing for injecting vaccine against coronavirus or ncov 19 or covid into patient's arm\nAdobe Stock\nWHO experts revise Covid-19 vaccine advice, say healthy kids and teens low risk\nNamely, adults ages 65 and older who have received a single dose of a bivalent vaccine may receive an additional dose at least four months following their first dose.\nMost individuals with certain degrees of immunocompromise who have received a first dose of a bivalent vaccine can get a second at least 2 months later.  Additional doses may be administered at the discretion of their healthcare provider.\nDr. Peter Hotez, who co-directs the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, has been calling on the FDA to increase access to the bivalent boosters for those who want them.  He says for the most part, today\u2019s guidance from the agency makes sense.\n\u201cMy only question is why the 65 year age cutoff? What was that based on? Ordinarily I would have preferred that it be brought down to 60 or even 50,\u201d Hotez said in an email to CNN.\n\u201cFor those Americans who understand its importance, we should make second bivalent boosters available. Finally, we\u2019ll soon need guidance about another annual fall booster. Presumably that information comes sometime this summer,\u201d he added.\nFor immunocompromised children ages 6 months through 4 years, eligibility for additional bivalent doses will depend on the vaccine previously received, the FDA said in a news release.\nAnother big change is that most unvaccinated individuals may now receive a single dose of a bivalent vaccine, rather than mutiple doses of the original single-strain vaccines, the agency said.  The FDA simplified its recommendation for unvaccinated individuals after recognizing that most Americans now have some immunity against Covid-19, even if its just through past infections.\n\u201cEvidence is now available that most of the U.S. population 5 years of age and older has antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, either from vaccination or infection that can serve as a foundation for the protection provided by the bivalent vaccines. COVID-19 continues to be a very real risk for many people, and we encourage individuals to consider staying current with vaccination, including with a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. The available data continue to demonstrate that vaccines prevent the most serious outcomes of COVID-19, which are severe illness, hospitalization, and death,\u201d said Dr. Peter Marks, head of FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a\nnews release\n.\nAnti-vaccine rally protesters hold signs outside of Houston Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas, on June 26, 2021. - A spokesperson for Houston Methodist Hospital said on June 23, 153 employees either resign or were fired for refusing to be vaccinated.

Children who are age 5 may receive two doses of the Moderna bivalent or a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine.\nChildren ages 6 months through 5 years who got started on their monovalent vaccines, can now get a dose of a bivalent vaccine, but the number of doses they qualify for will depend on the number of doses they\u2019ve already had and what kind of vaccine they got.\nThe agency stressed that most people who have gotten one dose of a bivalent vaccine are not currently eligible for a second dose.\nAnd they encouraged everyone who hasn\u2019t yet gotten their first dose of a bivalent vaccine to do so, and many Americans are still in that bucket.\nOnly about 17% of those eligible, less than 1 in 5 Americans, has gotten a recommended dose.\nAs time has passed, adults with reduced immune function because of their age or an underlying health problem have been asking doctors whether they need another dose of the bivalent vaccines.\nThe United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported early data showing that the effectiveness of the bivalent vaccines, even against emergency room visits and hospitalizations, has already started to wane.\nBut the agency has not been free to make what\u2019s known as a \u201cpermissive use\u201d recommendation about the boosters, which would allow doctors to offer additional doses to vulnerable patients because of the terms of the EUA.\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter\nSign up here to get\nThe Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta\nevery Friday from the CNN Health team.\nThe updated terms give the CDC and its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) greater freedom to recommend additional doses of the bivalent vaccines. The ACIP is holding a meeting on the Covid-19 vaccines Wednesday and is expected to endorse the FDA\u2019s changes.\nFor everyone not covered by today\u2019s changes, the FDA says it intends to make decisions about future vaccinations after receiving recommendations on the fall strain composition from its advisory committee in June.\nBoth\nCanada\nand the\nUnited Kingdom\nhave offered another round of bivalent boosters to those at highest risk from Covid-19 this spring.",

That level of trust that a commanding officer develops across that unit has to be able to be grounded on dignity and respect, and so \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 if that officer can lawfully join the United States Navy, is willing to serve and willing to take the same oath that you and I took to put their life on the line, then I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m proud to serve beside them.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nSome Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill have attacked the military for being too \u201a\u00c4\u00fawoke,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 claiming it has been one of the causes of the military\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s poor recruiting numbers, despite a recent Army survey showing only 5% of potential recruits were concerned about \u201a\u00c4\u00fawokeness.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nLast month, Republican Rep. Cory Mills and several others went after the Defense Department on its diversity, equity and inclusion training at a House Armed Services Subcommittee hearing on military personnel. Mills said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe absolutely 150% can out-pronoun every single one of our adversaries, and China and Russia I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m sure are quaking in their boots over this.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nIn response, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Gil Cisneros said diversity and equal opportunity training have been a part of the military for decades.\nAt another hearing in early-March with the military\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s top enlisted leaders, Sgt. Maj. Of the Army Michael Grinston stressed that the military\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s focus remains on combat lethality, even with additional training on diversity and inclusion.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere is one hour of equal opportunity training in basic training, and 92 hours of rifle marksmanship training,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Grinston said at the time. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAnd if you go to [One Station Unit Training], there is 165 hours of rifle marksmanship training and still only one hour of equal opportunity training.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9",

The DA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office also accused the lawyer of failing to present an immunity deal to her clients last year, according to the filing.\nThe new filing offers the latest indication that immunity offers could still be in the works months after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis suggested charging decisions were \u201a\u00c4\u00faimminent.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nBrian Kemp.\nNathan Posner/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp urges Republicans to move on from election fraud claims: '2020 is ancient history'\nIt notes that investigators interviewed some of the fake GOP electors this month and there is jockeying behind the scenes ahead of the announcement on who, if anyone, will face charges in the long-running probe into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe statement of some of her clients that directly implicate another client in additional crimes shows that Ms. Debrow\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s continued participation in this matter is fraught with conflicts of interest that rise to the level of her being disqualified from this case in its entirety,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the district attorney\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office wrote in the filing.\nDuring the April 2023 interviews, \u201a\u00c4\u00fasome of the electors stated that another elector represented by Ms. Debrow committed acts that are violations of Georgia law and that they were not party to these additional acts,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the filing.\nAmid a fight last year to compel the fake electors to testify, the court instructed two attorneys, including Debrow, to inform their clients with potential immunity deals.

        "full_content": "CNN\n\u2014\nHigh speed trains have proved their worth across the world over the past 50 years.\nIt\u2019s not just in reducing journey times, but more importantly, it\u2019s in driving economic growth, creating jobs and bringing communities closer together. China, Japan and Europe lead the way.\nSo why doesn\u2019t the United States have a high-speed rail network like those?\nFor the richest and most economically successful nation on the planet, with an increasingly urbanized population of more than 300 million, it\u2019s a position that is becoming more difficult to justify.\nAlthough Japan started the trend with its\nShinkansen \u201cBullet Trains\u201d in 1964\n, it was the advent of France\u2019s TGV in the early 1980s that really kick-started a global high-speed train revolution that continues to gather pace.\nRelated article\nNew trains and new rail routes to experience in Japan\nHigh-speed train revolution\nPassengers prepare to board a Shinkansen bullet train in Kyoto, Japan.\nIssei Kato/Reuters\nBut it\u2019s a revolution that has so far bypassed the United States. Americans are still almost entirely reliant on congested highways or the headache-inducing stress of an airport and airline network prone to meltdowns.\nChina has built around 26,000 miles (42,000 kilometers) of dedicated high-speed railways since 2008 and plans to top 43,000 miles (70,000 kilometers) by 2035.\nMeanwhile, the United States has just 375 route-miles of track cleared for\noperation at more than 100 mph\n.\nMany Americans have no concept of high-speed rail and fail to see its value. They are hopelessly stuck with a highway and airline mindset.\nWilliam C. Vantuono, editor-in-chief of Railway Age\n\u201cMany Americans have no concept of high-speed rail and fail to see its value. They are hopelessly stuck with a highway and airline mindset,\u201d says William C. Vantuono, editor-in-chief of Railway Age, North America\u2019s oldest railroad industry publication.\nCars and airliners have dominated long-distance travel in the United States since the 1950s, rapidly usurping a network of luxurious passenger trains with evocative names such as \u201cThe Empire Builder,\u201d \u201cSuper Chief\u201d and \u201cSilver Comet.\u201d\nDeserted by Hollywood movie stars and business travelers, famous railroads such as the New York Central were largely bankrupt by the early 1970s, handing over their loss-making\ntrains to Amtrak\n, the national passenger train operator founded in 1971.\nIn the decades since that traumatic retrenchment, US freight railroads have largely flourished. Passenger rail seems to have been a very low priority for US lawmakers.\nPowerful airline, oil and auto industry lobbies in Washington have spent millions maintaining that superiority, but their position is weakening in the face of environmental concerns and worsening congestion.\nBillions for rail improvements\nUS\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill\nincludes an unprecedented $170 billion for improving railroads.\nSome of this will be invested in repairing Amtrak\u2019s crumbling Northeast Corridor (NEC) linking Boston, New York and Washington.\nThere are also big plans to bring passenger trains back to many more cities across the nation \u2013 providing fast, sustainable travel to cities and regions that have not seen a passenger train for decades.\nAdd to this the success of the privately funded Brightline operation in Florida, which has been given the green light to build a $10 billion high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and Las Vegas by 2027, plus schemes in California, Texas and the proposed Cascadia route linking Portland, Oregon, with Seattle and Vancouver, and the United States at last appears to be on the cusp of a passenger rail revolution.\nRelated article\nSpain's high-speed railway revolution\nBigger investment\nAmtrak plans to introduce its new generation Avelia Liberty trains to replace the Acelas, pictured, on the NEC later this year.\nDavid Boe/AP\n\u201cEvery president since Ronald Reagan has talked about the pressing need to improve infrastructure across the USA, but they\u2019ve always had other, bigger priorities to deal with,\u201d says Scott Sherin, chief commercial officer of train builder Alstom\u2019s US division.\n\u201cBut now there\u2019s a huge impetus to get things moving \u2013 it\u2019s a time of optimism. If we build it, they will come. As an industry, we\u2019re maturing, and we\u2019re ready to take the next step. It\u2019s time to focus on passenger rail.\u201d\nSherin points out that other public services such as highways and airports are \u201cmassively subsidized,\u201d so there shouldn\u2019t be an issue with doing the same for rail.\nHigh-speed rail is not the solution for everything, but it has its place.\nScott Sherin, CCO of Alstom's US division\n\u201cWe need to do a better job of articulating the benefits of high-speed rail \u2013 high-quality jobs, economic stimulus, better connectivity than airlines \u2013 and that will help us to build bipartisan support,\u201d he adds. \u201cHigh-speed rail is not the solution for everything, but it has its place.\u201d\nOnly Amtrak\u2019s Northeast Corridor has trains that can travel at speeds approaching those of the 300 kilometers per hour (186 mph) TGV and Shinkansen.\nEven here, Amtrak Acela trains currently max out at 150 mph \u2013 and only in short bursts. Maximum speeds elsewhere are closer to 100 mph on congested tracks shared with commuter and freight trains.\nNew generation of trains\nThis year, Amtrak plans to introduce its new generation Avelia Liberty trains to replace the life-expired Acelas on the NEC.\nCapable of reaching 220 mph (although they\u2019ll be limited to 160 mph on the NEC), the trains will bring Alstom\u2019s latest high-speed rail technology to North America.\nThe locomotives at each end \u2013 known as power cars \u2013 are close relatives of the next generation\nTGV-M trains\n, scheduled to debut in France in 2024.\nSitting between the power cars are the passenger vehicles, which use Alstom\u2019s Tiltronix technology to run faster through curves by tilting their bodies, much like a MotoGP rider does. And it\u2019s not just travelers who will benefit.\n\u201cWhen Amtrak awarded the contract to Alstom in 2015 to 2016, the company had around 200 employees in Hornell,\u201d says Shawn D. Hogan, former mayor of the city of Hornell in New York state.\n\u201cThat figure is now nearer 900, with hiring continuing at a fast pace. I calculate that there has been a total public/private investment of more than $269 million in our city since 2016, including a new hotel, a state-of-the-art hospital and housing developments.\n\u201cIt is a transformative economic development project that is basically unheard of in rural America and if it can happen here, it can happen throughout the United States.\u201d\nAlstom has spent almost $600 million on building a US supply chain for its high-speed trains \u2013 more than 80% of the train is made in the United States, with 170 suppliers across 27 states.\n\u201cHigh-speed rail is already here. Avelia Liberty was designed jointly with our European colleagues, so we have what we need for \u2018TGV-USA\u2019,\u201d adds Sherin.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all proven tech from existing trains. We\u2019re ready to go when the infrastructure arrives.\u201d\nAnd those new lines could arrive sooner than you might think.\nRelated article\nTaiwan's extraordinary 111-year-old forest railway gets a makeover\nIncoming high-speed lines\nIn March, Brightline confirmed plans to begin construction on a 218-mile (351-kilometer) high-speed line between Rancho Cucamonga, near Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, carving a path through the San Bernardino Mountains and across the desert, following the Interstate 15 corridor.\nThe 200 mph line will slash times to little more than one hour \u2013 a massive advantage over the four-hour average by car or five to seven hours by bus \u2013 when it opens in 2027.\nMike Reininger, CEO of Brightline Holdings, says: \u201cAs the most shovel-ready high-speed rail project in the United States, we are one step closer to leveling the playing field against transit and infrastructure projects around the world, and we are proud to be using America\u2019s most skilled workers to get there.\u201d\nBrightline West expects to inject around $10 billion worth of benefits into the region\u2019s economy, creating about 35,000 construction jobs, as well as 1,000 permanent jobs in maintenance, operations and customer service in Southern California and Nevada.\nIt will also mark the return of passenger trains to Las Vegas after a 30-year hiatus \u2013 Amtrak canceled its \u201cDesert Wind\u201d route in 1997.\nBrightline hopes to attract around\n12 million of the 50 million one-way trips\ntaken annually between Las Vegas and LA, 85% of which are taken by bus or car.\nAnother California project\nContruction is underway on California High Speed Rail (CHSR,) a high-speed system between Los Angeles and San Francisco.\nDavid Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\nMeanwhile, construction is progressing on another high-speed line through the San Joaquin Valley.\nSet to open around 2030, California High Speed Rail (CHSR) will run from Merced to Bakersfield (171 miles) at speeds of up to 220 mph.\nCoupled with proposed upgrades to commuter rail lines at either end, this project could eventually allow high-speed trains to run the 350 miles (560 kilometers) between Los Angeles to San Francisco metropolitan areas in just two hours and 40 minutes.\nCHSR has been on the table as far back as 1996, but its implementation has been controversial.\nDisagreements over the route, management issues, delays in land acquisition and construction, cost over-runs and inadequate funding for completing the entire system have plagued the project \u2013 despite the economic benefits it will deliver as well as reducing pollution and congestion. Around 10,000 people are already employed on the project.\nCosting $63 billion to $98 billion, depending on the final extent of the scheme, CHSR is to connect six of the 10 largest cities in the state and provide the same capacity as 4,200 miles of new highway lanes, 91 additional airport gates and two new airport runways costing between $122 billion and $199 billion.\nWith California\u2019s population expected to grow to more than 45 million by 2050, high-speed rail offers the best value solution to keep the state from grinding to a smoggy halt.\nCorridors for the greatest potential\nBrightline West and CHSR offer templates for the future expansion of high-speed rail in North America.\nBy focusing on pairs of cities or regions that are too close for air travel and too far apart for car drivers, transportation planners can predict which corridors offer the greatest potential.\n\u201cIt\u2019s logical that the US hasn\u2019t yet developed a nationwide high-speed network,\u201d says Sherin. \u201cFor decades, traveling by car wasn\u2019t a hardship, but as highway congestion gets worse, we\u2019ve reached a stage where we should start looking more seriously at the alternatives.\n\u201cThe magic numbers are centers of population with around three million people that are 200 to 500 miles apart, giving a trip time of less than three hours \u2013 preferably two hours.\n\u201cWhere those conditions apply in Europe and Asia, high-speed rail reduces air\u2019s share of the market from 100% to near zero. The model would work just as well in the USA as it does globally.\u201d\nRelated article\nHow one European country is planning a 'rail revolution'\nPipe dream?\nFrench high-speed train the TGV Duplex, built in the 1990s, has a maximum speed of 186 miles per hour.\nLeoty X/Andia/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\nSherin points to the success of the original generation of Acela trains as evidence of this.\n\u201cWhen the first generation Acela trains started running between New York City and Washington in 2000, Amtrak attracted so many travelers that the airlines stopped running their frequent \u2018shuttles\u2019 between the two cities,\u201d he adds.\nHowever, industry observer Vantuono is more pessimistic.\n\u201cA US high-speed rail network is a pipe dream,\u201d he says. \u201cA lack of political support and federal financial support combined with the kind of fierce landowner opposition that CHSR has faced in California means that the challenges for new high-speed projects are enormous.\u201d\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), urban and high-speed rail hold \u201cmajor promise to unlock substantial benefits\u201d in reducing global transport emissions.\nDespite the advent of cars and airplanes, rail of all types has continued to evolve and thrive.\nFatih Birol, IEA executive director\nDr. Fatih Birol, the IEA\u2019s executive director, argues that rail transport is \u201coften neglected\u201d in public debates about future transport systems \u2013 and this is especially true in North America.\n\u201cDespite the advent of cars and airplanes, rail of all types has continued to evolve and thrive,\u201d adds Birol.\nGlobally, around three-quarters of rail passenger movements are made on electric-powered vehicles, putting the mode in a unique position to take advantage of the rise in renewable energy over the coming decades.\nHere, too, the United States lags far behind the rest of the world, with electrification almost unheard of away from the NEC.\nRail networks in SouthKorea, Japan, Europe, China and Russia are more than 60% electrified, according to\nIEA figures\n, the highest share of track electrification being South Korea at around 85%.\nIn North America, on the other hand, less than 5% of rail routes are electrified.\nThe enormous size of the United States and its widely dispersed population mitigates against the creation of a single, unified network of the type being built in China and\nproposed for Europe\n.\nAir travel is likely to remain the preferred option for transcontinental journeys that can be more than 3,000 miles (around 4,828 kilometers).\nBut there are many shorter inter-city travel corridors where high-speed rail, or a combination of new infrastructure and upgraded railroad tracks or tilting trains, could eventually provide an unbeatable alternative to air travel and highways.",

(It is also, apparently, National Animal Crackers Day for those who celebrate.)\nWhether you have already filed your tax return or still need to, the good news is this tax filing season has gone\nmuch more smoothly\nthan the past three, which were hurt by the pandemic.\n\u201cThis is the first tax season since 2019 where the IRS and the nation were on normal footing,\u201d IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a call with reporters.\nFor instance, Werfel noted that since January, thanks to an infusion of some new\nfunding\nafter years of budget cuts, IRS employees have been able to answer 87% of calls from filers with questions. Last year, they answered fewer than 15%. And the wait times on those phone calls dropped to just 4 minutes this filing season from 27 minutes last filing season.\nThe agency also added a roster of new online tools for filers, he added.\nStill haven\u2019t filed?\nNot everyone has to file on April 18:\nIf you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there \u2014 or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area \u2014 it\u2019s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you.\nHere\nis where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.\nNot everyone has to file on April 18:\nIf you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there \u2014 or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area \u2014 it\u2019s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you.\nHere\nis where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.\nThanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California \u2014 which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers \u2014 have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson.\nIf you\u2019re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone.\nThis IRS publication\noffers more detail.\nAdobe Stock\nTaxes and adulting: What to know about filing taxes on your own for the first time\nLastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the\nEarned Income Tax Credit\n. (Use\nthis IRS tool\nto gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use\nIRS Free File\n(intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won\u2019t cost you to submit a return.\nYour paycheck may not be your only source of income:\nIf you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that\u2019s not necessarily so.\nOther potentially taxable and reportable income sources include:\nInterest on your savings\nInvestment income (e.g., dividends and capital gains)\nPay for part-time or seasonal work, or a side hustle\nUnemployment income\nSocial Security benefits or distribution from a retirement account\nTips\nGambling winnings\nIncome from a rental property you own\nOrganize your tax documents:\nBy now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.).\nIf you don\u2019t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts \u2014 a document may have been sent to you electronically.\nHere are some of the tax forms you may have received:\nW-2\nfrom your wage or salaried jobs\n1099-B\nfor capital gains and\nlosses\non your investments\n1099-DIV\nfrom your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments\n1099-INT\nfor interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution\n1099-NEC\nfrom your clients, if you worked as a contractor\n1099-K\nfor payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The\n1099-K\nis required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold\ndrops to $600\n.) But even if you didn\u2019t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022.\n1099-Rs\nfor distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract\nSSA-1099 or SSA-1042S\nfor Social Security benefits received.\n\u201cBe aware that there\u2019s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you\u2019re responsible for reporting it on your own,\u201d according to the Illinois CPA Society.\nOne very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill:\nIf you\u2019re eligible to make a\ntax-deductible contribution to an IRA\nand haven\u2019t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you\u2019re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings.\nProofread your return before submitting it:\nDo this whether you\u2019re using tax software or working with a\nprofessional tax preparer\n.\nLittle mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of\nyour refund\nif you\u2019re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank.\nWhat to do if you can\u2019t file by April 18:\nIf you\u2019re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out\nForm 4868\nelectronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.\nA U.S. Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 1040 Individual Income Tax form for the 2019 tax year. Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nDaniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nYour tax refund may be smaller this year. Here's why\nNote, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven\u2019t paid by April 18.\nSo if you suspect you still owe tax \u2014 perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn\u2019t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year \u2014 approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday.\nYou can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.\nOr the more efficient route is\npay what you owe electronically\nat IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. \u201cThe IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,\u201d the agency notes in its instructions.\nIf you opt to electronically\npay directly\nfrom your bank account, which is free,\nselect \u201cextension\u201d\nand then \u201ctax year 2022\u201d when given the option.\nYou can also pay by credit or debit card,\nbut you will be charged a\nprocessing fee\n. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don\u2019t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances.\nIf you can\u2019t pay what you owe in full, the IRS does have some\npayment plan options\n. But it might be smart to first consult with a certified public accountant or a tax preparer who is an enrolled agent to make sure you are making the best choice for your circumstance.\nIf you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state\u2019s revenue department, Martin said.\nUse this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have:\nThe IRS provides an \u201c\ninteractive tax assistant\n\u201d that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.\nAlready filed?\nIf you\u2019ve already filed your return, you\u2019re probably glad to have it in the rear view mirror. But you may still have a few questions about what\u2019s ahead.\nWhat about my refund?\nIf you are due a refund, the IRS typically sends it within 21 days of receiving your return. When yours does arrive, it\nmay be smaller\nthan last year, even if your financial life didn\u2019t change much. That\u2019s because a number of Covid-related tax breaks expired.\nSo far, the average refund paid was $2,878 for the week ending April 7, down from $3,175 at the same point in last year\u2019s filing season.\nWill I be audited?:\nThe reasons and methods for auditing a taxpayer can vary \u2014 and many audits result in \u201cno change,\u201d meaning you don\u2019t end up owing anything more to the IRS. But one thing is common for the vast majority of US tax filers: Audit rates are exceedingly low.\nFor filers reporting incomes between $50,000 and $200,000, only 0.1% of them were audited in 2020, according to the latest data from the IRS. Even for very high income filers, audit rates were quite low: Just 0.4% for those reporting income of between $1 million and $5 million; 0.7% for those with income between $5 million and $10 million; and 2.4% for returns with income over $10 million.\nLooking ahead, the IRS commissioner noted in a press call that the agency will be using money from the Inflation Reduction Act to bolster its compliance efforts to\nfocus more on auditing high-income\nindividuals \u2014 defined as making $400,000 or more. As for filers with income below that level, he said he did not anticipate any change in the likelihood they would be audited.",

Her latest film, \u201cThe American Dream and Other Fairy Tales,\u201d co-directed with Kathleen Hughes, made its world premiere at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival.

View\nmore opinion\non CNN.\nCNN\n\u2014\nTuesday is Tax Day in America, one of the most stressful days of the year, when many taxpayers will finally end their procrastination, file their federal returns, and hope for a refund from the IRS. But for many of the nation\u2019s wealthiest, it\u2019s just another Tuesday.\nAbigail Disney\nGrasstaken, Roo Castro and Rod Coplin\nMorris Pearl\nBeatrice Mortiz\nTax Day isn\u2019t just a filing deadline \u2014 it\u2019s also an annual reminder that the ultra-rich exist in an entirely separate world when it comes to taxes. For us, the loopholes are bigger and the rates are sometimes lower. Meanwhile, the rich keep getting richer, with the\nwealth\nof billionaires in particular growing by more than $1.5 trillion over the last few years.\nThis status quo is unfair, but even more importantly, it\u2019s unsustainable. Such high levels of inequality are pushing our economy and our democracy to their breaking points. That\u2019s why we should examine how we can set our country up for long-term stability and prosperity. And we should start by ensuring that the ultra-rich pay more of what they owe the country that made their success possible.\nThere are three changes to the tax code that would help us do just that:\nTax all types of income the same for high earners\nRight now, the US tax system values money over sweat. If you work hard for your money instead of earning it passively, you\u2019re essentially penalized for it. People who earn a salary pay significantly higher tax rates on their income than wealthy investors who passively earn\ncapital gains\nincome.\nInheriting money is an even better deal. Thanks to former president Donald Trump\u2019s 2017\ntax law\n, the first $12.92 million (or $25.84 million for a married couple) is completely exempt from any\nestate tax\n, and the\nstepped-up basis loophole\nallows wealthy families to permanently erase millions in capital gains taxes by resetting the market value of those assets to their value at the time of the original owner\u2019s death. With this, it becomes relatively simple for the rich to inherit tens, even hundreds of millions of dollars, and pay almost nothing in taxes. Someone working for that money, on the other hand, would pay over a third of it in federal income taxes.\nCubicle with Box of Personal Belongings - stock photo\nBill Varie/The Image Bank RF/Getty Images\nOpinion: The hard lessons I learned the first time I was laid off\nWhy do we have a tax code that says working people should be taxed more than wealthy investors and those who got rich just by virtue of being born into the right family? At the end of the day, money is money, whether you worked for it or whether you inherited it. As an heiress and an investor, we should not be paying lower tax rates than people who earn their money from working.\nIt\u2019s time for the tax code to treat all income equally by taxing all capital gains over $1 million at the same rates as ordinary income, and replacing our loophole-ridden estate tax with a simpler inheritance tax that treats inherited wealth as income.\nTax wealth or unrealized capital gains\nWe can\u2019t just focus on income, however, because many of the richest Americans earn basically no taxable income of any kind in a typical year. Capital gains are only taxed when assets are sold, so instead of selling them, the ultra-rich use their assets as collateral to borrow vast sums of money at extremely low interest rates to live on, and then declare little or even negative \u201cincome\u201d on their tax forms. This \u201c\nBuy, Borrow, Die\n\u201d strategy is a major reason billionaires paid a\nlower effective tax rate\nover recent years than working-class families.\nBy rethinking what is taxable, we can get access to the trillions of dollars of billionaire wealth that is untouchable under our current tax structure. That\u2019s why President Biden has proposed the\nBillionaire Minimum Income Tax\n, which would tax the unrealized capital gains of the wealthiest households and why others have proposed wealth taxes on billionaires.\nTax the highest earners more\nFinally, one of the most straightforward changes needed is to simply tax the extremely rich more than the merely rich. Our\nincome tax\ncaps out at a top rate of 37% for any income over $578,125 (or $693,750 for married couples). No matter how much more someone makes, they\u2019ll never pay more than 37% in federal income taxes.\nWhile someone earning $600,000 is certainly making enough to live a very comfortable life, they\u2019re in a different world than someone making $600 million a year. In order to reflect the real differences between the rich and the ultra-rich, we need to return to the\ntop rates\nwe had through the most prosperous decades of the 20th century and add significantly more tax brackets. They should reach up to 90% for people making more than $100 million a year.\nGet our free weekly newsletter\nSign up for CNN Opinion\u2019s\nnewsletter.\nJoin us on\nTwitter\nand\nFacebook\nThese three changes certainly won\u2019t fix all our country\u2019s problems on their own, but they would go a long way in stopping the steady flow of our country\u2019s wealth toward a smaller and smaller group of people, a change that would make both our democracy and our economy more stable. The tax code can be a powerful tool for both social and economic change. We just need to use it more effectively.",

The newest, however, might well be record-breaking.\nA three-kilometer-long (1.8-mile) cycling and pedestrian tunnel has been blasted through the base of L\u00f8vstakken mountain and its makers say it\u2019s the longest purpose-built tunnel of its kind.\nFyllingsdalstunnelen, as it\u2019s known, opened on April 15 with a family day of sporting activities, following four years of construction that began in February 2019. The state-funded mega-project cost close to $29 million, or 300 million Norwegian kroner.\n\u201cWe Norwegians are usually modest people,\u201d Camilla Einarsen Heggernes, a spokesperson for rail company Bybanen Utbygging, tells CNN, \u201cBut in this instance we would say that the tunnel is 100% state of the art.\u201d\nWhen you see this sundial, you'll know you're halfway through.\nRonny Tur\u00f8y/Bybanen Utbygging\nIt takes a little under 10 minutes to whizz through the tunnel by bike and around 40 if strolling by foot. To break up the monotony of the windowless tunnel, there are a variety of art installations throughout, as well as different colors and lighting to help users place where they are on the journey and offer a sense of direction.\nAt the center point is a \u201csundial\u201d installation \u2013 where the sun definitely will never shine \u2013 which shows the time of day, again helping to orientate visitors and also to break up the otherwise long line of sight. The tunnel is otherwise perfectly straight, apart from slight curvatures at entrance and exit.\nIf you\u2019re wondering how cyclists and pedestrians can use the same space, there are two lanes in the tunnel: a 3.5-meter wide bike lane and a 2.5-meter-wide lane for walkers and runners. \u201cWe have laid down a blue rubber flooring throughout the tunnel, similar to an athletic track, explains Einarsen Heggernes. \u201cThis makes it more pleasant to use than if one would just walk on asphalt.\u201d\nThe tunnel was constructed in parallel with a new tram line.\nNCC/Bybanen Utbygging\nThe man who cycled 870 miles for a croissant\nThe new tunnel came about as a byproduct of Bergen\u2019s second Bybanen tram line, which opened in November 2022. The tram line through the mountain required a parallel evacuation tunnel, so the developers decided to make the new tunnel multipurpose.\nBergen is Norway\u2019s second-largest city and the port city is linked to Oslo, the Norwegian capital, by the 496-kilometer Bergensbanen railway line. This stunning rail journey crosses Europe\u2019s largest high mountain plateau, the Hardangervidda, and its snow-clad vistas were the backdrop for the battle scenes in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d sequel \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back.\u201d\nWhile the Fyllingsdalstunnelen is pitching itself as the world\u2019s longest purpose-built cycle tunnel, the reason for that caveat is the 3.6-kilometer-long Snoqualmie Tunnel in Washington, just east of Seattle. This former train tunnel is now a passageway for cyclists, runners and walkers and is part of the 250-mile Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail.\nSix European cities made it in CNN Travel\u2019s recent roundup of 10 of the world\u2019s\nmost bike-friendly cities\n. Copenhagen has 385 kilometers of bike lanes, having introduced its first one way back in 1892. Strasbourg in France has around 6,000 bikes available at self-service stations 24/7 which tourists can use. And the Swiss capital of Bern has a exhilarating downhill trail for riders who feel the need for speed. The best bit is that cyclists can get a funicular up to the top then ride down \u2013 no uphill struggle.",

The selected images were shot by photographers from more than 30 countries in locations ranging from an abandoned cement factory in China to a fish market in Somalia.\n\u2018Misleading\u2019 claims\nThe World Photography Organisation, which runs the competition, told CNN in a statement Tuesday that, during the competition\u2019s exchanges with Eldagsen ahead of announcing him as a category winner on March 14, he had confirmed the \u201cco-creation\u201d of this image using AI.\n\u201cThe creative category of the open competition welcomes various experimental approaches to image making from cyanotypes and rayographs to cutting-edge digital practices,\u201d organizers said.\n\u201cAs such, following our correspondence with Boris and the warranties he provided, we felt that his entry fulfilled the criteria for this category, and we were supportive of his participation. Additionally, we were looking forward to engaging in a more in-depth discussion on this topic and welcomed Boris\u2019 wish for dialogue by preparing questions for a dedicated Q&A with him for our website.\n\u201cAs he [Eldagsen] has now decided to decline his award we have suspended our activities with him and in keeping with his wishes have removed him from the competition. Given his actions and subsequent statement noting his deliberate attempts at misleading us, and therefore invalidating the warranties he provided, we no longer feel we are able to engage in a meaningful and constructive dialogue with him.\u201d\nThe statement said organizers recognize \u201cthe importance of this subject and its impact on image-making today.\u201d\n\u201cWhile elements of AI practices are relevant in artistic contexts of image-making, the awards always have been and will continue to be a platform for championing the excellence and skill of photographers and artists working in the medium,\u201d the World Photography Organisation added.\nTop image: Boris Eldagsen\u2019s AI-generated image titled \u2018Pseudomnesia: The Electrician\u2019 was submitted to the Sony World Photography Awards 2023 and won first prize in the creative open category.\nCNN\u2019s Oscar Holland contributed to this report.",

        "full_content": "CNN\n\u2014\nWhat does intimacy look like for seniors? There\u2019s no end to sex scenes and other steamy content featuring the young and unwrinkled, but past a certain age, popular culture largely draws a blank \u2014 or treats sex as a punchline.\nLast year, the artist Marilyn Minter set out to change that, gathering a group of men and women aged 70 and older in her New York studio to showcase a lesser-seen side of sex and relationships. In erotic and colorful images, the seniors are stripped down to lingerie or briefs; they hug, kiss and caress each other in the heat of the moment. The photographs beckon our attention to challenge something still seen as taboo, showing playful, loving moments of pleasure.\nCold, remote and short of women: A portrait of life on the Faroe Islands\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much contempt for elder sex. Even one of the models that I worked with said, \u2018Who wants to see all these?\u2019\u201d Minter recalled in a video call with CNN.\n\u201cMy whole thought process going into it was that we\u2019re pioneers,\u201d she continued of the unabashedly sexualized context. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever shot elder people affectionately, and with any kind of elegance. And that was my goal \u2014 to make to make them look very desirable.\u201d\n\"Elder Sex\" is Marilyn Minter's full set of images originally shot for a New York Times Magazine story on senior sex and intimacy.\nMarilyn Minter/Courtesy Marilyn Minter & LGDR\nA handful of the ensuing images were originally published in the New York Times Magazine, accompanying a\ncandid editorial feature\nabout seniors\u2019 sex lives. Minter is now publishing the series in full in the forthcoming book \u201cElder Sex,\u201d and exhibiting them at New York gallery LGDR. The exhibition,\nwhich opened in April\n, is her first solo show in the city since the Brooklyn Museum mounted her retrospective \u201cPretty/Dirty\u201d in 2016, and features highlights from her five-decade-long career, as well as other new bodies of work.\nSeeking partners\nIn \u201cElder Sex,\u201d Minter utilized one of her signature aesthetics, which she has explored in both hyperrealistic paintings and photographs: jewel-toned, close-cropped compositions of glistening bodies, seemingly shown through the glass of a steamed-up mirror or window. But despite her credentials as one of the most important and boundary-breaking artists today \u2014 and despite stars such as\nLady Gaga\nand\nLizzo\nposing for her \u2014 Minter couldn\u2019t find enough real couples willing to participate.\nThe images \"give permission to people who feel shame about their sexual urges,\" Minter said.\nMarilyn Minter/Courtesy of JBE Books & LGDR\n\u201cWe wanted to (include) all races, all types of sex,\u201d Minter explained. \u201cWe had a lot of trouble getting models. I\u2019m 74. I asked all my friends \u2014 in mixed-race relationships, in lesbian relationships \u2014 and none of them would do it.\u201d\nIn the end, Minter cast actors along with the few people who had agreed. She paired them together in her studio, photographing them behind a panel of frozen glass \u2014 a trick to achieve the steamy, wet look without battling the ephemerality of water vapor. During their shoots, Minter said all her models, who were as old as 89 years old, told her they still had regular, enjoyable sex lives. Their sentiments matched the people interviewed for the New York Times Magazine article, who described deepening intimacy with their partners later in life, as well as learning to navigate and appreciate their needs as their bodies aged.\nSeniors do have regular sex lives, but it's rarely discussed. Minter says all her models told her they still enjoy intimacy.\nMarilyn Minter/Courtesy of JBE Books & LGDR\nMinter believes there\u2019s a sense of freedom in sex later in life that, for many people, can take time to reach.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re young and having sex, it\u2019s a little more performative than it is when you\u2019re 80,\u201d she said. As an older person, \u201cYou\u2019re thinking, \u2018This is me. Take it or leave it. I\u2019m just going to enjoy myself. I\u2019m not going to fake anything here.\u2019\u201d\n'The Ugly Duchess:' How an unsettling Renaissance portrait challenges ideas of aging women and beauty\nChanging attitudes\nMinter acknowledges that sex and self-image is fraught for women of all ages \u2014 older women are rarely seen or taken seriously as having intimate needs, while for younger women, sexual agency is often a tightrope walk \u2014 too much of it and you can be \u201cexcoriated and slut-shamed,\u201d Minter said.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re 25, there\u2019s just so much fear about young women owning sexual agency \u2014 it\u2019s just terrifying to people,\u201d she said.\nVideo Ad Feedback\nMarilyn Minter unveils steamy 'shower' images\n01:51\n- Source:\nCNN\nBut the artist sees some progress in who gets to be seen as desirable on our television screens, reflecting a burgeoning broader shift in cultural attitudes around sex. She pointed to photographs in People magazine comparing the characters of  \u201cThe Golden Girls\u201d and \u201cSex and the City,\u201d who are the same age at the time of the latter\u2019s reboot on HBO Max (which is owned by CNN\u2019s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery). \u201cThe 50s look a lot different in the 2020s!\u201d a caption exclaimed.\nThough \u201cThe Golden Girls\u201d also delved into romance and intimacy \u2014 and was widely-viewed as remarkably sex-positive for its time \u2014 there\u2019s a stark contrast in how women in their 50s are presented across the two shows.\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Okay, here\u2019s why it\u2019s different,\u201d she said. \u201cNumber one: People live a lot longer, and they\u2019re healthier\u2026 Number two: there\u2019s this thing called Viagra.\u201d Minter laughed, adding: \u201cBut who retired at 54? To a home in Florida with three other ladies? What?\u201d\nMinter hopes \"Elder Sex\" will serve as a radical body of work and will help normalize sex at older ages.\nMarilyn Minter/Courtesy of JBE Books & LGDR\nShe hopes \u201cElder Sex\u201d will not only serve as a much-needed visual reference for what intimacy can look like at older ages, but will also resonate for people who feel like their desires \u2014 and lives \u2014 are overlooked.\n\u201cIt gives permission to people who feel shame about their sexual urges,\u201d she said. \u201cI want this to give them permission to explore that and erase the shame.\u201d\n\u201c\nElder Sex\n,\u201d published by JBE Books, is available now.",

        "full_content": "Hong Kong\nCNN\n\u2014\nChina\u2019s economy\ngot off to a solid start in 2023, as consumers went on a spending spree after three years of strict pandemic restrictions ended.\nGross domestic product grew by 4.5% in the first quarter from a year ago, according to the\nNational Bureau of Statistics\non Tuesday. That beat the estimate of 4% growth from a Reuters poll of economists.\nBut\nprivate investment\nbarely budged and youth unemployment surged to the second highest level on record, indicating the country\u2019s private sector employers are still wary\nabout\nlonger term prospects\n.\nConsumption posted the strongest rebound. Retail sales jumped 10.6% in March from a year earlier, the highest level of growth since June 2021. In the January to March months, retail sales grew 5.8%, mainly lifted by a surge in revenue from the catering service industry.\n\u201cThe combination of a steady uptick in consumer confidence as well as the still-incomplete release of pent-up demand suggest to us that the consumer-led recovery still has room to run,\u201d said Louise Loo, China lead economist for Oxford Economics.\nIndustrial production also showed a steady increase.\nIt was up 3.9% in March, compared with 2.4% in the January-to-February period. (China usually combines its economic data for January and February to account for the impact of the Lunar New Year holiday.)\nCommuters during Beijing's morning rush hour in April 2023\nMark Schiefelbein/AP\nLast year, GDP expanded by\njust\n3%, badly missing the official growth target of \u201caround 5.5%,\u201d as Beijing\u2019s approach to stamping out the coronavirus wreaked havoc on supply chains and hammered consumer spending.\nAfter mass street protests gripped the country and local governments ran out of cash to pay huge Covid bills, authorities finally scrapped the zero-Covid policy in December. Following a brief period of disruption due to a Covid surge, the economy has started showing signs of recovery.\nLast month, an official gauge of non-manufacturing activity jumped to its highest level in more than a decade, suggesting the country\u2019s crucial services sector was benefiting from a resurgence in consumer spending after the end of pandemic restrictions.\nAs the economic recovery gains traction, investment banks and international organizations have upgraded China\u2019s growth forecasts for this year. In its World Economic Outlook released last week, the International Monetary Fund said China is \u201crebounding strongly\u201d following the reopening of its economy. The country\u2019s GDP will grow 5.2% this year and 5.1% in 2024, it predicted.\nPrivate business retreat\nHowever, some analysts believe the strong growth reported in the first quarter was the product of \u201cbackloading\u201d of economic activity from the fourth quarter of 2022, which was weighed down by pandemic restrictions and then a chaotic reopening.\n\u201cOur core view is that China\u2019s economy is deflationary,\u201d said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Research, in a Tuesday research report.\nIf adjustments are made to account for the impact of delayed economic activity, GDP growth in the first quarter could have been just 2.6%, he said.\nSome key data released on Tuesday support this idea. For example, private investment was extremely weak.\nFixed asset investment by the private sector increased a mere 0.6% from January to March, indicating a lack of confidence among entrepreneurs. (State-led investment, meanwhile, advanced 10%.) That\u2019s even worse than the 0.8% growth recorded in the January-to-February period.\nThe Chinese government has resorted to\nsurprising measures\nto restore confidence among private entrepreneurs, but the campaign has inspired more nervousness than optimism.\nAerial view of the construction site of the Hainan Free Trade Port on April 4, 2023 in Haikou, Hainan Province of China.\nLuo Yunfei/China News Service/VCG/Getty Images\nChina resorts to unusual measures to restore confidence among entrepreneurs. But it's not working\nThe all-important property industry is also mired in a deep downturn. Investment in property declined 5.8% in the first quarter. Property sales by floor area decreased by 1.8%.\n\u201cThe domestic economy is recovering well, but the constraints of insufficient demand are still obvious,\u201d said Fu Linghui, a spokesman for the NBS, at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. \u201cPrices of industrial products are still falling, and enterprises are facing many difficulties in their profitability.\u201d\nYouth unemployment surges\nUnemployment continued to surge\namong the youth.\nThe jobless rate for 16- to 24-year-olds hit 19.6% in March, up for a third straight month. It was the second highest on record, only behind the 19.9% level reached in July 2022.\nThe high jobless rate among the youth suggests \u201cslack in the economy,\u201d Yeung said.\nA large number of job seekers line up outside an exhibition center square in Nanning, Guangxi Province, China, Feb. 18, 2023.

But youth unemployment is getting worse\n\u201cBy June, there will be a new batch of graduates looking for jobs. The jobless condition could worsen further if China\u2019s economic momentum falters,\u201d he added.\nChina\u2019s education ministry has previously estimated that a record 11.6 million college graduates will be looking for jobs this year.\nAt last month\u2019s meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress, the country\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament, the government set a cautious growth plan for this year, with a GDP target of around 5% and a job creation target of 12 million.",

Wives in these marriages spend roughly 2 hours more per week on caregiving than husbands do and about 2.5 hours more on housework,\u201d the study notes.\nIn 55% of opposite-sex marriages, men are the primary or sole breadwinners, earning a median of $96,000 to their wives\u2019 $30,000.\nAdobe Stock\nThe US gender pay gap: Why it hasn't narrowed much in 20 years\nMeanwhile, in 16% of marriages the wives outearn their husbands as the primary (10%) or sole breadwinner (6%). In these marriages women earn a median of $88,000 to their husbands\u2019 $35,000.\nOf all of these categories, the only one in which men are reported to spend more time caregiving than their wives is when the woman is the sole breadwinner. And the time spent per week on household chores in those marriages is split evenly between husbands and wives.\nIn all instances, it\u2019s a big change from 50 years ago \u2014 when, for instance, husbands were the primary breadwinner in 85% of marriages.\nThese are the women most likely to be the biggest earner\nToday, which women are most likely to be the primary or sole breadwinners can vary by age, family status, education and race.\nFor instance, Pew found Black women are \u201csignificantly more likely\u201d than other women to earn more than their husbands. For instance, 26% of Black women bring home more than their husbands, while only 17% of White women and 13% of Hispanic women do.\nBut Black women with a college degree or higher and few children at home are also among the most likely to earn about the same as their husbands.\nThese numbers are reported against a backdrop of society\u2019s attitudes about who should earn more and how caregiving should be divvied up between spouses.\nNearly half of Americans (48%) in Pew\u2019s survey said husbands prefer to earn more than their wives, while 13% said men would prefer their wives earn about the same as them.\nWhat do women want? Twenty-two percent of Americans said most women want a husband who earns more, while 26% said most would want a man who earns about the same.\nMeanwhile, when it comes to having a family, 77% said that children are better off when both parents focus equally on their job and on taking care of the kids. Only 19% said children are better off when their mother focuses more on home life and their father focuses more on his job.\nThe Pew study is based on three data sources: earnings data from the US Census\u2019 Current Population Survey; data from the American Time Use Survey and a nationally representative survey of public attitudes among 5,152 US adults conducted in January.",

Cheese, gooier. Onion will be added to patties right on the grill. And the Big Mac sauce? There will be more of it.\n\u201cWe found that small changes, like tweaking our process to get hotter, meltier cheese and adjusting our grill settings for a better sear, added up to a big difference in making our burgers more flavorful than ever,\u201d said chef Chad Schafer, senior director of culinary innovation of McDonald\u2019s USA, in a statement Monday. The upgrades apply to the Big Mac and the McDouble burger as well as the classic cheeseburger, double cheeseburger and hamburger.\nThe Big Mac will come with more Big Mac sauce.\nMcDonald's USA\nThe improvements were first made to burgers in international markets, the company said, and have already arrived in some US cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Phoenix, Las Vegas. They\u2019ll be available nationally by early next year.\nThe changes follow other improvements to key menu items.\nIn 2018, McDonald\u2019s announced that it was switching to\nfresh beef for its Quarter Pounders\n, a\ncomplicated move\nwith\na big sales payoff\n. In 2021, it\nlaunched a crispy chicken sandwich\nto replace previous iterations \u2014 a relatively\nlate arrival in the chicken sandwich wars\n, but one that seems to have resonated with McDonald\u2019s customers. .\n\u201cWe are gaining market share in both chicken and beef,\u201d thanks to improved burgers and items like the chicken sandwich, said McDonald\u2019s\n(MCD)\nCEO Chris Kempczinski during a January analyst call. \u201cIn an environment where our customers are looking for the simple and familiar, our core menu items have never been more relevant,\u201d he said.

And McDonald\u2019s has been using promotions like\ncelebrity meal platforms\nand the adult\nHappy Meal\nto create buzz around its signature items.\n\u201cThroughout 2022, some of our most successful campaign platforms brought our customers closer to the core menu items,\u201d Kempczinski said during the January call.\nMcDonald\u2019s isn\u2019t the only brand trying to improve its main offerings.\nBurger King, which last year announced a\nplan to turn its business around\n, has been focusing on improving the Whopper and making it more visible in advertising. In the fourth quarter last year, it held Whopper trainings for franchisees. The brand said in February that the Whopper contributed to higher US sales in that quarter.",

(CNN has not reviewed the material.)\nIn an effort to address the heightened competition, Google is said to be developing a new AI-powered search engine called Project \u201cMagi,\u201d according to the Times. The company, which reportedly has about 160 people working on the project, aims to change the way results appear in Google Search and will include an AI chat tool available to answer questions. The project is expected to be unveiled to the public next month, according to the report.\nIn a statement sent to CNN, Google spokesperson Lara Levin said the company has been using AI for years to \u201cimprove the quality of our results\u201d and \u201coffer entirely new ways to search,\u201d including with a feature\nrolled out last year\nthat lets users search by combining images and words.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done so in a responsible and helpful way that maintains the high bar we set for delivering quality information,\u201d Levin said. \u201cNot every brainstorm deck or product idea leads to a launch, but as we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re excited about bringing new AI-powered features to Search, and will share more details soon.\u201d\nSamsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nScreen with ChatGPT chat with AI or artificial intelligence.

Warsaw, Poland - December 02, 2022.\nirissca/Adobe Stock\nThe way we work is about to change\nGoogle\u2019s search engine has dominated the market for two decades. But the viral success of ChatGPT, which can generate compelling written responses to user prompts, appeared to put Google on defense for the first time in years.\nIn March, Google began opening up access to Bard, its new AI chatbot tool that directly competes with ChatGPT and promises to help users outline and write essay drafts, plan a friend\u2019s baby shower, and get lunch ideas based on what\u2019s in the fridge.\nAt an event in February, a Google executive also said\nthe company will bring \u201cthe magic of generative AI\u201d directly into its core search product and use artificial intelligence to pave the way for the \u201cnext frontier of our information products.\u201d\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, has\ninvested in\nand partnered with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to deploy similar technology in Bing and other productivity tools. Other tech companies, including Meta, Baidu and IBM, as well as a slew of startups, are racing to develop and deploy AI-powered tools.\nBut tech companies face risks in embracing this technology, which is known to\nmake mistakes\nand \u201challucinate\u201d responses. That\u2019s particularly true when it comes to search engines, a product that many use to find accurate and reliable information.\nGoogle was\ncalled out\nafter a demo of Bard provided an inaccurate response to a question about a telescope. Shares of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet fell 7.7% that day, wiping $100 billion off its market value.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Bing AI demo was also called out for\nseveral errors\n, including an apparent failure to differentiate between the types of vacuums and even made up information about certain products.\nIn\nan interview with 60 Minutes\nthat aired on Sunday, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai stressed the need for companies to \u201cbe responsible in each step along the way\u201d as they build and release AI tools.\nFor Google, he said, that means allowing time for \u201cuser feedback\u201d and making sure the company \u201ccan develop more robust safety layers before we build, before we deploy more capable models.\u201d\nHe also expressed his belief that these AI tools will ultimately have broad impacts on businesses, professions and society.\n\u201cThis is going to impact every product across every company and so that\u2019s, that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s a very, very profound technology,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, we are just in early days.\u201d",

I did not have to make a rushed road trip across state lines to get my medicine, unlike many women who need the drug but live in one of the many states that have restricted access to medication abortion or passed near-total bans on abortion.\nI was not forced to set up a secret meet-up with a stranger in order to buy my medicine on the black market, as several women I spoke to recently said they planned to do. Nor did I have to\norder mifepristone online\nand find myself navigating\nthe many scammers\ntaking advantage of the current patchwork of state abortion laws in the US.\nMassachusetts Democratic Gov.

(AP Photo/Steven Senne)\nSteven Senne/AP\nOpinion: Anti-abortion advocates are using junk science to usurp the will of the American people\nMifepristone is one of two drugs used in a medication abortion and the other, misoprostol, was not subject to the ruling by the Texas judge. The two drugs can be administered to someone having a miscarriage, allowing them to terminate the pregnancy when the fetus is not viable.\nIt happened some years ago: After experiencing more than a day of hemorrhaging during the first trimester of my pregnancy, I visited my ob-gyn, who explained after examining me that my blood pressure was dropping rapidly and the heavy bleeding I was experiencing was an unmistakable sign of a miscarriage.\nFor many women, being prescribed mifepristone is part of their routine medical care. Not so in my case: As my doctor explained, I was facing a dire medical emergency. I was grateful for the medication that saved my life.\nMy miscarriage took me by surprise. I had loved being pregnant the first time around, about a decade earlier. And as a healthy woman, I had no reason for fear when I became pregnant again. By the time I was administered mifepristone, I was losing a life that I had already begun to love. And like many other women, despite my level of education or economic status, I could not outrun the statistics that put Black women at higher risk.\nUp to one in four known pregnancies\nwill end in a miscarriage. And for Black women, the numbers are alarmingly higher. According to an analysis of 4.6 million pregnancies in seven countries, the risk of a miscarriage for Black women is\n43% higher than for White women\n.\nFormer President Donald Trump sits at the defense table with his defense team in a Manhattan court, Tuesday, April 4, 2023, in New York.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\nSeth Wenig/Pool/AP\nOpinion: Texas judge's stunning ruling caps extraordinary week\nIn the Black community, women have traditionally been taught to bear their burdens silently \u2014 keep your business to yourself \u2014 even after something as devastating as pregnancy loss. We are conditioned to do as I did back then, and keep it moving as we try to outrun the long list of statistics that tell us our lives are in danger from every direction, whether it be from health care risks to societal injustices or other stressors.\nDuring my miscarriage, I was a woman who was afraid, hemorrhaging and in excruciating pain, in desperate need of safe, emergency medical care. Thanks to the administration of mifepristone, I was allowed dignity during my miscarriage. It\u2019s what every woman deserves \u2014 whether it be facing a potentially life-threatening miscarriage or seeking an abortion.\nI learned from my experience that every miscarriage matters. Women must have access to whatever medicines and counseling we need to help us heal and that includes mifepristone. What we don\u2019t need is to be criminalized by politicians and punitive reproductive laws that have long been out of step with public opinion. Despite the continuing political attacks on women\u2019s reproductive rights, more than 61% of US adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to\nPew Research Center\n.\nAfter the US Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to intervene, Justice Samuel Alito issued a\ntemporary order\nto preserve the status quo, ensuring access to the drug while giving the justices more time to study the issue.\nI am hoping the justices can put politics aside and focus on the science surrounding the safety of mifepristone, a drug that, thankfully, I had access to when my life was in danger. Mifepristone, a synthetic steroid, is even\nsafer than\ncommon prescription drugs including penicillin and Viagra.\nFollowing the science demands that, regardless of where you stand on the issue of abortion, consideration must be made for cases like mine and the millions of other women who for years have\nsafely used this medication\nfor complications surrounding miscarriages.\nGet our free weekly newsletter\nSign up for CNN Opinion\u2019s new\nnewsletter.\nJoin us on\nTwitter\nand\nFacebook\nWe do not know how the legal fight over medication abortion will unfold. But women across the nation \u2013 in blue and red states alike  \u2013 are watching. Punitive laws like the one\nsigned last week\nby Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis seek to criminalize reproductive care providers. And worse, they are stripping us of rights that men take for granted \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely they will be prohibited by the law from making health care decisions about their own bodies.\nIt must end. And I\u2019m betting that whether it be with our voice or our votes, women will have the last word.",

He was the Democratic vice presidential nominee in the 2000 presidential election. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View\nmore opinion\non CNN.\nCNN\n\u2014\nWhen Ralph Nader ran for president in 2000, he offered a simple rationale for a bid that would ultimately help\n\u201cspoil\u201d\nthe election for the Democratic ticket I was privileged to be on with Al Gore. In Nader\u2019s view, the two parties were ideologically indistinguishable.\nThat argument was baseless. There were\nsignificant differences\nin\npolicy\nbetween the George W. Bush-Dick Cheney ticket \u2014 which ended up victorious, in part\nthanks to Nader\n\u2014 and ours. For Nader, this wasn\u2019t really about the \u201ctwo-party duopoly,\u201d as he coined it. This was about his\ndesire\nto\npush\nGore and the Democratic Party to the left.\nJoe Lieberman\nCourtesy Joe Lieberman\nToday, of course, no one can reasonably argue that the two parties aren\u2019t ideologically distinct. The core problem in Washington, DC, is that they\u2019re too divided to get much done.\nThough a\nmajority\nof Americans long for the era when Republicans and Democrats worked together to find bipartisan solutions to big problems, many members of Congress refuse to work together on\nimmigration\n, the\ndebt ceiling\nand other issues critical to the nation, even when bipartisanship is the way to restore our common prosperity and security.\u00a0Indeed, today, with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats the Senate, bipartisanship is the only way to pass any legislation.\nWhile undoing the divisions plaguing our political system will not be simple, there is one step that can be taken \u2014 and it begins with giving voters a real alternative in the 2024 presidential election.\nMost often, when Americans cast their votes for president and vice president, their ballot has only two viable tickets: one nominated by the Democratic Party and the other by the Republican Party. But what would happen if they had a third viable option?\nThe process for adding that third viable option is not only arduous and time-consuming, but it\nvaries from state to state\nand in the District of Columbia.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks to Iowa voters gathered at the Iowa State Fairgrounds on March 10, 2023 in Des Moines, Iowa.\nScott Olson/Getty Images\nOpinion: Don\u2019t count DeSantis out yet; the GOP\u2019s 2024 race is far from over\nToday,\nNo Labels\n, a nonprofit organization that I co-chair, is laying the groundwork for such a campaign in 2024. Since early 2022, our team has been diligently working across the country to obtain ballot access for a potential No Labels ticket, typically by collecting a certain number of petition signatures from voters in each state.\nIf we are successful, a unity ticket \u2014 comprised of one Democrat and one Republican \u2014 could be presented to voters right next to the Republican and Democratic nominees.\nWe think of this as an insurance policy for the country \u2014 an option to be deployed if, and only if, both of the two major party nominees fail to offer voters a choice of candidates they\u2019d like to vote for or a way out of the partisan divisiveness that now dominates in the nation\u2019s capital. We will be consistently monitoring the sentiment of Americans through our own research and polling, as well as public polling, to make that determination.\nIn this and several other ways, No Labels\u2019 effort could not be more different from the \u201cspoiler\u201d campaign that Nader attempted two decades ago.\nFirst, if No Labels were to lend its ballot lines to a presidential ticket, the presidential candidate would be a Democrat and the vice presidential candidate would be a Republican, or vice versa. As such, it would appeal to some voters who might otherwise have voted for the Democratic ticket, and other voters who might otherwise have voted for the Republican ticket. And it would appeal to still other voters who would not have voted for either.\nPresident Joe Biden delivers remarks at the DNC 2023 Winter Meeting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., February 3, 2023.\nElizabeth Frantz/Reuters\nOpinion: Why Biden is lying low ahead of 2024\nThese nominees would be selected by a diverse and distinguished group of citizens serving on a committee \u2014 and would be ratified by delegates who would gather at the No Labels National Convention planned for April 2024. This convention will occur about six weeks after the March 5th \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d primaries, a day which historically has clarified who the major party nominees will be.\nSecond, No Labels\u2019 2024 effort is not designed to push the Democratic nominees to the left or Republican candidates to the right. Rather, it\u2019s intended to force one or both parties to appeal to America\u2019s growing commonsense majority. If they don\u2019t, our ballot line will create the opening for a unity ticket that will.\nAccording to\nrecent polling by CNN\n, the number of individuals who identify as independent is on the rise, now comprising 41% of the electorate \u2014 compared to only 28% who described themselves as Democrats and 31% who described themselves as Republicans. These numbers are more evidence that there could be a potential path to victory for an independent ticket in 2024.\nBut if there doesn\u2019t appear to be such a path in the months ahead, No Labels will stand down, focusing instead on the work we have done over the last decade to elect and organize members of the House and Senate who have demonstrated the courage to reach across the aisle \u2014 including members of the bipartisan\nHouse Problem Solvers Caucus.\nGet Our Free Weekly Newsletter\nSign up for CNN Opinion\u2019s newsletter\nJoin us on\nTwitter\nand\nFacebook\nIt seems the Biden administration already may be beginning to recognize the imperative of appealing to the commonsense majority. President Joe Biden\nrecently signed into law\na Republican measure to strike down a Washington, DC, crime bill reducing penalties for those who commit violent crimes, and he announced more stringent\nborder control\npolicies.\nOur hope is that the Republicans jockeying for their party\u2019s nomination will similarly see the need to reach out beyond their base instead of appealing to\ndivisive\npolicies and politics.\nIn the end, No Labels hopes\nnot\nto have to offer our ballot line to an independent unity ticket. We want the parties to come to their senses. But judging from the angry and apocalyptic\nreactions\nof strategists in both parties at the thought of No Labels\u2019 insurance policy, it is clear that party leaders now know that there could be a political cost to ignoring the commonsense majority. And that\u2019s a reason to hope for a better future for our government and our country.",

Trump pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges stemming from an investigation into a hush-money payment to an adult film actress. The former president also is facing criminal probes in other jurisdictions\nover efforts to overturn the 2020 election\nand\nhis handling of classified documents\nat Mar-a-Lago.\nBragg sued Jordan\nand his committee last week in federal court, accusing the Judiciary Committee chairman of a \u201c\ntransparent campaign to intimidate and attack\n\u201d his office for its investigation and prosecution of Trump\nby making demands\nfor confidential documents and testimony.\nWhile Jordan and his committee appear focused on\ndiscrediting the investigation\ninto Trump, why aren\u2019t they looking into two recent\nbombshell reports\nby ProPublica that raised red flags about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 financial relationship with GOP megadonor Harlan Crow? After all, the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s\nwebsite\nexplains that it has jurisdiction over \u201cmatters relating to the administration of justice in federal courts\u201d \u2013 for which the revelations concerning Thomas fit perfectly.\nAssociate US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas poses for the official photo at the Supreme Court in Washington, DC on October 7, 2022.\nOlivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images\nThe Clarence Thomas revelations are the last straw. It's time for Congress to act\nFirst, we learned in early April that Crow had provided Thomas and his wife, Ginni, for decades with\nluxurious vacations\nincluding on the\ndonor\u2019s yacht and private jet\nto faraway places such as Indonesia and New Zealand. That information was never revealed to the public. (In a rare public statement,\nThomas responded\nhe was advised at the time that he did not have to report the trips. The justice said the guidelines for reporting personal hospitality\nhave changed recently\n. \u201cAnd, it is, of course, my intent to follow this guidance in the future,\u201d he said.)\nThen on Thursday, ProPublica reported that Thomas\nfailed to disclose\na 2014 real estate deal involving the sale of three properties he and his family owned in Savannah, Georgia, to that same GOP megadonor, Crow. One of Crow\u2019s companies made the purchases for $133,363, according to ProPublica.\nA federal disclosure law\npassed after Watergate requires Supreme Court justices and other officials to make public the details of most real estate sales over $1,000.\nAs\nProPublica\ndetailed, the federal disclosure form Thomas filed for that year included a space to report the identity of the buyer in any private transaction, but Thomas left that space blank. Four\nethics law experts told ProPublica\nthat Thomas\u2019 failure to report it appears to be a violation of the law. (Thomas did not respond to questions from ProPublica on its report; CNN reached out to the Supreme Court and Thomas for comment.)\nAssociate US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas poses for the official photo at the Supreme Court in Washington, DC on October 7, 2022.\nOlivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images\nThomas revelation of gifts fits a broader pattern of financial nondisclosure from the Supreme Court\nThe House Judiciary Committee has long addressed issues such as those surrounding Thomas. In fact, the committee is where investigations and\nthe impeachment\nof federal judges often commence.\nOne recent example came in 2010 with Judge\nG. Thomas Porteous Jr.\n, whom the committee investigated and recommended for impeachment.\nThe committee\u2019s Task Force on Judicial Impeachment\nsaid evidence showed Porteous \u201cintentionally made material false statements and representations under penalty of perjury, engaged in a corrupt kickback scheme, solicited and accepted unlawful gifts, and intentionally misled the Senate during his confirmation proceedings.\u201d The Senate later\nfound Porteous guilty\nof\nfour articles of impeachment\nand removed him from the bench.\nYet the Judiciary Committee has neither\nreleased statements\nnor\ntweets\nraising alarm bells about Thomas. Instead, its Twitter feed is filled with\nrepeated tweets\nwhining that\nC-SPAN won\u2019t cover\nMonday\u2019s New York field hearing. Worse, the committee retweeted GOP\nRep. Mary Miller\u2019s tweet\ndefending Thomas as being attacked \u201cbecause he is a man of deep faith, who loves our country and believes in our Constitution.\u201d\nJordan\u2019s use of his committee to assist Trump should surprise no one. The House January 6 committee\u2019s report called the Ohio Republican \u201c\na significant player in President Trump\u2019s efforts\n\u201d to overturn the election.

When it became public, the Zimmerman Telegram caused a sensation, helping propel the US into the conflict against Germany.\n\u201cNever before or since has so much turned upon the solution of a secret message,\u201d wrote David Kahn in his classic 1967 history of secret communications, \u201cThe Codebreakers.\u201d The Germans had taken great pains to keep their intentions confidential, and the codebreakers in London\u2019s\n\u201cRoom 40\u201d\nhad to do a lot of work to decipher the telegram.\nTheir efforts stand in stark contrast to the ease with which secrets came tumbling out of a Pentagon intelligence network when 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guard cyber specialist Jack Teixeira allegedly posted hundreds of documents on a Discord chatroom known as \u201cThug Shaker Central.\u201d The disclosures likely won\u2019t start a war, but they could prove extremely damaging to the US and several of its allies, including Ukraine.\nClay Jones\nTeixeira is one of\nmore than one million people\nwho have Top Secret clearance. \u201cThe Pentagon has already started taking steps to limit the number of people who have access to such sensitive information,\u201d wrote\nBrett Bruen\n, a former US diplomat and Obama administration official. \u201cBut much more can be done. \u2026 Why do so many people, especially those working short stints in government,\nhave access to information that can shape the fate of nations and their leaders?\n\u201d\nWriting in the Financial Times,\nKori Schake\nsaw \u201csome good news.\u201d\n\u201cWhile specific details will be incredibly valuable to Russia and other adversaries, these are not bombshell revelations: journalists had already reported Ukrainian ammunition running low; peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv were never likely; allies have long been aware that the US eavesdrops on them; and the disparaging assessment of Ukraine\u2019s forthcoming offensive may prove no more accurate than previous predictions were.\u201d These will not prove as damaging as the\nEdward Snowden\nand\nChelsea Manning\ndisclosures.\nBut, she warned, \u201cTechnology making data ever more portable, distribution more global and communications more bespoke\nwill make it easier to amass information and distribute it\n\u2014 either privately or publicly.\u201d\nDick Wright/Cagle Cartoons\nBack in the House\nNick Anderson/Tribune Content Agency\nIn less than a week, the two Democrats expelled from the Tennessee House for their participation in a gun control protest were sent back to office by local officials.\nWriting for CNN Opinion, Rep.\nJustin Pearson\nnoted, \u201cThis should be a chastening moment for revanchist forces in Tennessee\u2019s legislature and across the country. Over the long haul, the undemocratic machinations employed to oust us from office are destined to fail. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once famously said that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice. Events this week demonstrated, more than ever, that this is indeed the case\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOver two-thirds of Americans \u2014 including four out of 10 Republicans \u2014 support the kind of common sense gun safety laws that Rep. Jones, Rep. Johnson and I were protesting in favor of, in the wake of the senseless March 27 Covenant School massacre.\u201d\nGet our free weekly newsletter\nSign up for CNN Opinion\u2019s\nnewsletter.\nJoin us on\nTwitter\nand\nFacebook\n\u201cAnd yet,\ncalls for common sense gun reform measures fall on deaf ears in our legislature\nwhere a Republican supermajority is wildly out of step with most people\u2019s values.\u201d\nThe politics of gun control have shifted, argued Democratic strategist\nMax Burns\n. The NRA\u2019s internal struggles have weakened its influence while Democrats in office, who once feared touching the issue of guns, are increasingly speaking out. And they are making some progress in enacting new state laws, Burns noted.\n\u201cThe American people decisively support Democratic proposals for addressing the scourge of gun violence. Political watchers who criticized Democrats for talking too much about abortion during the 2022 midterm elections later ate crow after that once-dreaded culture war topic topped the list of voter concerns nationally\u2026\n\u201cBiden and the Democrats have the rare opportunity to build\nyet another winning coalition out of an issue once viewed as political poison.\n\u201d\nTop court calls a halt\nBill Bramhall/Tribune Content Agency\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court issued an order that temporarily ensured access to a key drug used in many medication abortions. The move gave the justices more time to consider the issue after a Texas federal judge suspended the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the abortion pill 23 years ago.\n\u201cIf abortion opponents are successful, access to the pill \u2014 reportedly used in more than half of abortions in the United States \u2014 will be severely undercut,\u201d wrote\nMichele Goodwin\nand\nMary Ziegler\n.\n\u201cBeyond the dangerous precedent this sets for challenges to other important FDA-approved drugs that some political factions don\u2019t like, the case is an alarming expression of the way right-wing activists are\nusing junk science to bypass the will of the American public and restrict abortion\n\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThere are no grounds for challenging mifepristone\u2019s approval, especially 23 years after the fact. The drug received extensive review \u2014 more than four years \u2014 before FDA approval. Moreover, claims that mifepristone threatens the health of those who take it are unfounded. The drug has a better safety record for use than Viagra and penicillin. Notably, it was available and used for years without incident in Europe.\u201d\nImprisoned\nIn 1986, Nicholas Daniloff, the Moscow bureau chief for US News & World Report, was seized by Soviet authorities and locked up in Lefortovo prison. He was the last American journalist to be arrested in Russia before last month\u2019s detention of Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich, who like Daniloff, speaks Russian fluently. Gershkovich has been charged with espionage but US officials have concluded that he was \u201cwrongfully detained.\u201d\nAs\nDavid A. Andelman\nnoted, Daniloff\u2019s detention in prison lasted for 13 days before he was put under house arrest and then eventually swapped for an accused Soviet spy. In a conversation with Andelman, Daniloff recalled his reaction when he was imprisoned. \u201cI felt claustrophobic, and I felt like I wanted to get out of there immediately. Of course, there was no chance of that. The door slams, and you have all these thoughts and feelings that run through you, and\nthen you settle down and you realize you\u2019re going to be hanging around that cell for some time.\n\u201d\nGershkovich\u2019s family in Philadelphia received a letter, handwritten in Russian, from the reporter Friday.\n\u201cI want to say that\nI am not losing hope\n,\u201d he noted. \u201cI read. I exercise. And I am trying to write. Maybe, finally, I am going to write something good.\u201d\n\u2018Mrs. Maisel\u2019\nThe Amazon series \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d returns this month for its fifth and final season \u2014 and\nDavid Perry\nis here for it. The series brings back memories of visiting his grandparents Irma and Mordy in their \u201ctiny rent-controlled Greenwich Village apartment,\u201d an experience that helped shape his Jewish identity.\n\u201cAs a Jewish historian,\u201d Perry wrote, \u201cI worry about the tension between preserving the memory of past hardships while not locking our entire history into a tale of oppression. The moments of peace and joy are as vital as the moments of violence. In fact, it\u2019s the periods of peace, of success, of interfaith community, that reveal the terrible truth about the violence: it wasn\u2019t inevitable. People could have made different choices\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA show like \u2018The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u2019\nlets me revel in my personal New York Jewish heritage while also getting a little break from all the worry\n. It\u2019s a warm, funny, sexy, extremely Jewish \u2026. comedy that hits me straight in my glossy childhood memories. That isn\u2019t to say the show isn\u2019t also problematic \u2014 it most certainly is.\u201d\nJane Goodall\u2019s answer\nIn the latest installment of CNN Opinion\u2019s \u201cLittle Kids, Big Questions\u201d series, 10-year-old Ronan wonders if animals are capable of being smarter than humans. With the help of the John Templeton Foundation, which is partnering on the project, the answer came from\nJane Goodall\n, world renowned for her work with chimpanzees.\n\u201cOne of the attributes of intelligence is the ability to think and solve problems. In the early 1960s, I was told that this was unique to humans, and only we could use and make tools, only we had language and culture,\u201d Goodall said. \u201cBut more and more research has proved that many animals are excellent at solving problems. Many use tools, and many show cultural differences. Some scientists believe that whales and dolphins are communicating with what may be a real language.\u201d\n\u201cAlthough the difference between humans and other animals is simply one of degree, our intellect really is amazing. \u2026bees can count and do math, and that just shows how much we still have to learn about animal intelligence.\nBut humans can calculate the distance to the stars\n.\u201d\nAbbott and Carlson\nNick Anderson/Tribune Content Agency\nEarlier this month, a Texas jury convicted Daniel Perry of murder for fatally shooting a Black Lives Matter protester in 2020. The jury deliberated for 17 hours and decided Perry\u2019s action couldn\u2019t be excused under the state\u2019s \u201cstand your ground\u201d law. Prosecutors argued Perry had instigated the incident and they introduced into evidence messages that suggested the shooting was not a spur-of-the-moment act but a premeditated one.\nOn the evening of the jury verdict, Fox News host Tucker Carlson criticized the decision and told viewers he had invited Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on the show to ask if he would consider pardoning Perry. Others on the right called for Abbott to issue a pardon, and the governor soon responded with an announcement that he would do just that, as long as the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles recommended that Perry should be granted one.\n\u201cTrial verdicts are determined by judges and juries,\u201d wrote\nDean Obeidallah\n. \u201c\nWhat Abbott is doing is not just wrong, it\u2019s dangerous.\nHis pardon, when it comes, is not what the rule of law looks like.\u201d\nWhat DeSantis and Biden have going for them\nChristopher Weyant/Cagle Cartoons\nTwo of the likeliest candidates for president in 2024 haven\u2019t officially committed yet.\nPresident Joe Biden says he intends to run again but has delayed making a formal announcement. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is making all the moves a presidential contender usually makes, including hawking his new book and visiting New Hampshire, but he hasn\u2019t joined fellow Republicans including former President Donald Trump, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson in declaring.\n\u201cDeSantis, who was neck and neck with the former president just a few months ago, may have lost a step or two in more recent polling. But his track record of successful governance in Florida should\nforce GOP voters to think long and hard about what version of their party they want to put forward\n,\u201d observed\nPatrick T. Brown\n.\n\u201cA third Trump presidential nomination would indicate that Republican primary voters may prefer style over substance. But if they are serious about not just making liberals mad but advancing actual policy, GOP voters should consider other names, starting with the Florida governor.\u201d\nEven without an official announcement by the president, wrote\nJulian Zelizer\n, the Biden-Harris campaign is very much under way. \u201cBy choosing to lie low while Republicans are gearing up for 2024, Biden is employing his version of what has become known as the \u2018Rose Garden Strategy,\u2019 whereby the incumbent campaigns by focusing on the business of being president and showing voters that he is the responsible figure in the race.\u201d\n\u201cThe president\u2019s understated strategy makes room for Republicans to stoke chaos, tear each other apart and make unforced errors while he remains above the fray for as long as possible. This strategy makes the GOP the focus of the election, allowing Biden to reinforce his message from 2020:\ndo voters want someone who will govern and act in a serious manner or do they want a circus?\n\u201d\nDon\u2019t miss\nGene Seymour\n:\nI am betting on Cousin Greg.

The airplane seat offered enough room for both of my legs and both of my arms. We took off on time and landed early. My shoes stayed on the whole time I was at the airport.\u201d\nIt was a vivid reminder of what\u2019s possible in air travel \u2014 and of what\u2019s usually lacking.\nTake the security system: \u201cMore than 20 years after Sept. 11, 2001, only passengers who pay for the privilege can avoid removing their shoes and laptops from their bags by submitting their personal information ahead of time and undergoing background checks.\u201d\nFilipovic added, \u201cAdmittedly, I do pay \u2014 I don\u2019t want to wait in a long security line, walk my stocking feet through a metal detector and have to un- and re-pack the MacBook I\u2019ve carefully crammed into my carry-on.\nBut the existence of pay-to-play shorter-line security options like Clear and TSA Pre-Check make clear that it is indeed possible\nto pre-screen a critical mass of passengers to avoid the morass of cranky people trying to pull on their shoes while re-packing their electronics.\u201d",

He is co-author of the book \u201c\nSudan\u2019s Unfinished Democracy\n.\u201d The views expressed here are his own. Read\nmore opinion\nat CNN.\nCNN\n\u2014\nFour years ago, almost to the day, the people of Sudan were celebrating a revolution after overthrowing longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir. Now the East African country faces\nthe possibility of a complete collapse\nsimilar to the chaos we see today in Yemen or Libya.\nJustin Lynch\nCourtesy Justin Lynch\nOn Saturday, rival military factions began fighting each other in the capital of Khartoum. The two sides battled for control of the nation\u2019s airports, bases and military compounds. Violence quickly spilled into the streets and across the country.\nSome 45 million Sudanese effectively are held hostage and are unable to venture out of their homes for fear of being killed in the crossfire.\nAt least 180 people\nhave perished in the fighting, including three\nWorld Food Programme\nhumanitarian workers.\nThe conflict pits two bitter rivals and their powerful armed forces against each other. On one side are the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. On the other side are the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemeti.\nThere is no good side in this conflict. Both have been accused of a long litany of human rights violations.\nHow did Sudan go from casting off despotic rule and creating a fledgling democracy a few years ago to teetering on the brink of state collapse?\nRevolution lost\nOn April 11, 2019, Sudan\u2019s longtime dictator, Bashir,\nwas overthrown\n. The cause of Bashir\u2019s removal was months of protests led by Sudan\u2019s unions, which spurred a military coup from the SAF and RSF. Both Burhan and Hemeti joined forces to remove their former boss.\nAbdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo\nGetty Images\nRival generals battle for control in Sudan. Here's a guide to the fighting\nIt was a moment of promise because there was hope for democracy. I remember walking around the \u201csit-in\u201d \u2014 a giant carnival of freedom in the middle of Khartoum that protesters had blocked off to demand change. It was electric.\nBut social movements such as the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) \u2014 the union behind the protest \u2014 often struggle to translate the momentum of their demonstrations into real political power.\nThe reason for this is, in part, structural. Social movements such as the SPA are often based on grassroots activism. A dictator can arrest one or two leaders of an organization but not an entire country.\nHowever, once a dictator is overthrown, these kinds of social movements often struggle to build the leadership hierarchy necessary during political negotiations that take place. Like many other movements, Sudan\u2019s protesters were unable to translate mobilization into political power.\nFleet reporting from northern Iraq in April 1991\nMaria Fleet\nAfter a lifetime spent in war zones, this is what stays with me above all else\nCivilian leaders entered into a negotiation with the military over the future of the country shortly after Bashir fell in April 2019. The two sides were not evenly matched. Because of these leadership challenges, the pro-democracy forces struggled to bargain with the disciplined military.\nAny momentum that pro-democracy advocates had during the negotiations was stamped out in June 2019 when RSF soldiers\nviolently dispersed\nthe sit-in. More than 100 people were killed.\nAfter the June massacre and the leadership challenges,\na transitional constitution\nwas signed in August 2019 that gave the SAF and RSF most of the power in Sudan. Burhan was the head of state, and Hemeti was placed in an elevated political position. Elections were promised in 2022, but few believed they would actually happen.\nA legacy of autocracy\nThe transitional period began in August 2019, and I interviewed\nAbdalla Hamdok\n, the civilian prime minister, several times for a book that I co-wrote on Sudan\u2019s revolution. The way that the constitution was written meant that Hamdok had limited power as the prime minister. Burhan was the head of state and wanted to preserve the powers of the SAF.\nHamdok often told me that revolutions come in cycles. The 2019 removal of Bashir was a high point of revolution, and he saw his job as making as many reforms as possible before the low tide of counterrevolution swept him away.\nHamdok found that the legacy of 30 years of dictatorship meant that Sudan\u2019s political and economic models were dilapidated. But Burhan and Hemeti blocked the big reforms that Hamdok wanted to make.\nThis photo provided by Organization for the General Coordination of Camps for Displaced and Refugees, smoke rises from Abu Zar camp for displaced persons in West Darfur, Sudan, on Tuesday, April 6, 2021.  The death toll from tribal violence in Sudan's Darfur region climbed as sporadic clashes continued on Tuesday, a local medical group and aid worker said. The violence poses a challenge to efforts by Sudan's transitional government to end decades-long rebellions in areas like Darfur, where conflict often falls along ethnic lines.  (Organization for the General Coordination of Camps for Displaced and Refugees via AP)\nOrganization for the General Coordination of Camps for Displaced and Refugees/AP\nDarfur's return to war would spell disaster for Sudan\nOutside Khartoum violence grew. Parts of Sudan such as Darfur saw a new round of conflict between ethnic groups orchestrated by RSF troops. More than 430,000 people\nwere displaced\ndue to conflict in Sudan, mostly in Darfur.\nSoldiers did not hide the atrocities they committed against civilians. I remember drinking tea with a soldier aligned with the RSF at his house in Darfur as he explained why he had recently participated in the burning down of a village from another ethnic group.\nThe soldier reasoned that a member of his tribe had been killed in an altercation, so the RSF-aligned forces took revenge by torching a village that had been home to\n30,000 people\n. At least\n163 people died\n.\nTensions between the SAF and RSF grew. Burhan viewed Hemeti and his RSF forces as upstart usurpers from Darfur who were undisciplined. Hemeti on the other hand believed that it was time for Darfur to lead Sudan.\nHamdok was on the cusp of beginning to turn the economy around when Burhan and the SAF intervened. As we wrote in the book \u201cSudan\u2019s Unfinished Democracy,\u201d the potential success of a civilian government was too much for Burhan. In October 2021,\nHamdok was removed\nin a military coup.\nInternational delusion\nAfter the October 2021 coup, the United States and United Nations pushed a worse version of the transitional constitution in Sudan.\nThey argued\nthat it was the best way to bring democracy.\nThe idea was to restart the transitional period, but I and many others argued it was shortsighted and\nwouldn\u2019t work\n. Returning to a government led by Burhan was clearly\nnot going to usher\nin democracy. If the plan ended in a coup the first time, why would it work the second time?\nBAKHMUT, UKRAINE - DECEMBER 3: A park avenue damaged due to hostilities on December 3, 2022 in Bakhmut, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. Russian troops trying to take Bakhmut for several months. Ukrainian soldiers hold the defense of the city, where the fiercest clashes take place. (Photo by Yan Dobronosov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)\nYan Dobronosov/Global Images Ukraine/Getty Images\nHow the battle for Bakhmut exposed Russia's 'meat-grinder'\nSome activists stopped partnering with the US and came to see the UN mission as\na roadblock to democracy\nbecause of these policies. I felt sorry when I spoke with the best American and foreign diplomats, who also understood the international policy in Sudan wouldn\u2019t work. They saw the flaws but felt powerless to dissent and were forced to carry out decisions made many levels above them.\nWhat preceded this weekend\u2019s outbreak of clashes was\na controversial part\nof the international policy that tried to unify the SAF and RSF. The idea was to make a single army, but neither Hemeti nor Burhan wanted to give up the power they had amassed.\nThe plan to unify the military hadn\u2019t worked in similar contexts. It was\na repeat\nof the 2013 and 2016 unification processes that took place in South Sudan with similarly bloody results. Instead, the tenuous relationship between Burhan and Hemeti boiled over due to the pressure.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nIt can be easy to look at the recent history of \u201crevolutions\u201d in countries such as Myanmar, Tunisia, Egypt and Sudan and conclude that they eventually backfire. I don\u2019t agree. I learned from Sudanese activists that a nation\u2019s political fortune is an active battle.\nGet our free weekly newsletter\nSign up for CNN Opinion\u2019s\nnewsletter.\nJoin us on\nTwitter\nand\nFacebook\nWe can one day hope that Sudan sees dreams of democracy come true.

        "full_content": "Editor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Note:\nThe following contains major spoilers about the fourth episode of \u201a\u00c4\u00faSuccession\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 fourth season, \u201a\u00c4\u00faHoneymoon States.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nCNN\n\u2014\nAfter the shock\ncame the aftershocks, the power vacuum, and perhaps most significantly and impressively, the laughs, as \u201a\u00c4\u00faSuccession\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 pivoted to face life after Logan Roy, in an episode that finally put the HBO show\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s title into full flower.\nLogan Roy\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s abrupt demise left his grown children and subordinates scrambling, with each seemingly humbly offering themselves up to fill the void, while fretting about how the various candidates would play with the company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s board.\nAt the same time, they mourned the larger-than-life figure they had lost, taking into account that he had treated many of them abysmally. And the fourth hour also marked the return of Logan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s wife, Marcia (Hiam Abbass), in what felt like \u201a\u00c4\u00faMarcia Strikes Back,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 while his current and much younger girlfriend, Kerri (Zoe Winter), was bluntly shown the door. (The latter evoked memories of the musical \u201a\u00c4\u00faEvita,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 when the title character boots Peron\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s mistress, who sings about another suitcase in another hall.)\nMore than anything, the episode underscored just how brutally funny \u201a\u00c4\u00faSuccession\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 can be, with Shiv (Sarah Snook) reading her father\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s obituary and musing, \u201a\u00c4\u00faDad sounds amazing. I would like to have met dad,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 while brothers Kendall (Jeremy Strong) and Roman (Kieran Culkin) hilariously translated the language, with references to Logan having been \u201a\u00c4\u00faa man of his time\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 equaling \u201a\u00c4\u00faracist.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nThe episode also showcased the executives\nat Waystar Royco, who uncomfortably wondered what to do with a document that included not only Logan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s posthumous wishes but hand-written notes that seemingly specified who he wished to succeed him. They joked, feebly, about tossing the paper in the toilet, while making very clear how much they really wanted to toss the paper in the toilet.\nAll the knives came out, with Carl (David Rasche) brutally insulting Tom (Matthew Macfadyen), scarcely hiding behind the fact that he was presenting the doubts about Tom\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s future as a hypothetical.\nAmid that, though, there were also human moments, with the tortured Kendall articulating his conflicted feelings to Waystar executive Frank (Peter Friedman) by saying, \u201a\u00c4\u00faHe made me hate him, and he died. I feel like he didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t like me. I disappointed him.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faSuccession\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 also underscored the fragility of not just life, but a corporate legacy, with the public-relations folk discussing how to spin and diminish Logan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s involvement in his later years as a means of bucking up the company and its stock price \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a maneuver that Kendall ultimately and surreptitiously approved, concluding that it was the sort of smart and ruthless move that his father would have executed.\nBrian Cox as Logan Roy in \"Succession.\"\nHBO\nQuestions of succession also appear to be threatening the harmony achieved by Kendall, Shiv and Roman prior to Logan\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s exit, with Shiv being left as the odd woman out in a plan to fill the CEO seat just long enough to close the sale to GoJo. Trust doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t come easily in series creator Jesse Armstrong\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s world, and when Shiv said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI need to wet my beak,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the assurances from her brothers clearly left the impression how easily that beak could wind up bent out of joint.\nUltimately, after the operating highs of the previous episode, the series successfully turned the page from grieving to the next order of business. And that too, as Kendall put it regarding Logan and the \u201a\u00c4\u00fabad dad\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 PR leaks, is \u201a\u00c4\u00fawhat he would do.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9",

        "full_content": "CNN\n\u2014\nOf the many dark gifts Showtime\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s eerie hit series \u201a\u00c4\u00fa\nYellowjackets\n\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 serves up for us, the juiciest this season is by far the music.\nThe show \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which bounces between a troupe of\nteen soccer players trapped in the 1990s\nCanadian wilderness after a plane crash and the survivors\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 corresponding adult selves in the present day \u201a\u00c4\u00ec embraces nostalgia, incorporating long-cherished tunes from the tail end of last century, with staples from Tori Amos, early Smashing Pumpkins, Massive Attack, Veruca Salt and much more.\nIn Sunday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s episode of \u201a\u00c4\u00faYellowjackets,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 alt-rock queen\nAlanis Morissette\nwill debut a version of the show\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s theme song, \u201a\u00c4\u00faNo Return,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and has already released it as a single.\nOne of the most unexpected and successful uses of throwback music came in the first episode of Season 2 last month, when Warren Kole\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Jeff had a moment to himself in the car after an intense tryst with wife Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) \u201a\u00c4\u00ec during which he rocks out hard to Papa Roach\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faLast Resort\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 (sure, the track actually came out in 2000, but that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t take away from its retro vibe).\nIn an interview with CNN, the show\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s music supervisor, Nora Felder, explained that the Papa Roach song selection was scripted, and \u201a\u00c4\u00faserved as a perfect physical outlet for Warren whose anxious feelings were riding high while sitting alone in his garage.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nOther standout moments in the script, however, are hers to interpret, and Felder relishes the opportunity to match those moments with the right songs from the period.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI re-immerse myself into the show\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s era and spirit of the times as I start to build my playlists for the show,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe main thing I try to keep in mind is to just stay true to the story and let it tell me what it might need musically.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nCase in point, from the same episode \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the placement of Amos\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s signature track \u201a\u00c4\u00faCornflake Girl,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 off her groundbreaking 1994 sophomore album \u201a\u00c4\u00faUnder the Pink.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nThe song \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which appropriately has the lyric \u201a\u00c4\u00faThings are getting kind of gross\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 just as teen Shauna (Sophie N\u221a\u00a9lisse) is about to ingest something unthinkable \u201a\u00c4\u00ec \u201a\u00c4\u00facame to mind pretty quickly as a possibility\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to Felder.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI felt that Amos\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s lyrics could serve as a befitting launchpad for the first episode\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ending \u201a\u00c4\u00ec not only as a reflection of Young Shauna\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s state of mind,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she noted, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut also as a reflection of the past and present moods and mentalities lived out by the other \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Yellowjackets\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 characters in Season 2.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nFelder\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s work is challenging, in the sense that there is often an ideal wish-list selection for a song during a certain moment in each script, which then might change either due to something technical or because the needs of the scene evolve during production, as a result of many elements, including the actors\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 performances.\n(From left): Sophie N\u221a\u00a9lisse, Courtney Eaton, Nia Sondaya, Alexa Barajas, Nuha Jes Izman and Mya Lowe in 'Yellowjackets.'\nColin Bentley/SHOWTIME\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faEveryone on the team always wants the best song-select possible to enhance the story,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen we get to post (production), the common question that comes up among us during the collaboration process is simply, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Do we think we can beat this?\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nDuring that collaborative process, Felder says she doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t \u201a\u00c4\u00fabelieve there is an exact roadmap into how to merge songs with any given scene or story.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI always say, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Let the picture tell you what it needs.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 (Kind of like the Wilderness I guess?)\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nAnother moment that feels perfectly melded to the music playing is the\nnow-infamous \u201a\u00c4\u00f2last supper\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 scene\nfrom last week\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second episode, which boasts Radiohead\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faClimbing By The Walls\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 from their mindblowing 1995 album \u201a\u00c4\u00faOK Computer\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 on the soundtrack.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe song seems to refer to those unspeakable monsters that can live in one\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s head,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Felder noted, referencing the strange collective hallucinations the group undergoes while cannibalizing one of their own. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think of a more perfect way to hauntingly accent (that) scene, a.k.a. \u201a\u00c4\u00f2the feast.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nTo drive home just how important music is to the specific ambient feel of \u201a\u00c4\u00faYellowjackets,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 one need look no further than the super creepy\nSeason 2 trailer\nfor the show, which features Florence + The Machine\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s exceptional and haunting rendition of No Doubt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s timeless 1995 hit, \u201a\u00c4\u00fa\nJust A Girl.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m such a huge fan of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Yellowjackets\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and this era of music, and this song especially had a huge impact on me growing up, so I was thrilled to be asked to interpret it in a \u201a\u00c4\u00f2deeply unsettling\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 way for show,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 band frontwoman Florence Welch said in a statement shared with CNN.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe tried to really add some horror elements to this iconic song to fit the tone of the show. And as someone who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first musical love was pop punk and Gwen Stefani, it was a dream job.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nOf her collaboration with \u201a\u00c4\u00faYellowjackets,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Morrisette, too, felt inspired by the show.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI see parallels between \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Yellowjackets\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and my perspective while songwriting: the sheer intensity, that going for the jugular with no fear around going for the profane,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Morissette said in a statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve strived my entire career to support the empowerment of women and sensitives, and see the world through the female lens, and what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s so wonderful about this show is that each character is allowed to be dynamic and complex as opposed to oversimplified, reduced versions of women. I feel honoured to be a part of the legacy of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Yellowjackets.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f9",

That paves the way for an even darker season that accentuates the show\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ensemble aspect while leaning a little too heavily on blurring lines with flights of fancy.\nThanks to\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faSuccession,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faBarry\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be the highest-profile goodbye on HBO this spring, but the Emmy-nominated series isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t chopped liver either. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fair to say, in fact, that while these episodes don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t quite measure up to what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gone before, even a less-lethal \u201a\u00c4\u00faBarry\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 is still very, very good.\nBill Hader\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s auteur turn\nas director-producer-star remains one of TV\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most unpredictable series, and the new season has a strong\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faBetter Call Saul\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nvibe to it, triggered by fallout from the seemingly inevitable fact that Hader\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Barry couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t maintain his double life forever.\nThe consequences of his arrest flare out to both sides of that equation, from his acting teacher Gene Cousineau (as played by\nHenry Winkler\n, still a towering mixture of ego and need) and girlfriend Sally (Sarah Goldberg) to the rogues gallery of petty criminals in his orbit, including Fuches (Stephen Root) and NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan), who has improbably found love in the course of his travels, while somehow turning \u201a\u00c4\u00faBarry\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 into a four-syllable name.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faBarry\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 has always wrestled with the discomfort of having a protagonist who murders people, and the question of empathizing with its namesake becomes particularly acute in these episodes with the character in prison. When Barry asks, \u201a\u00c4\u00faAre you mad at me?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with an almost-childlike naivete, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s easy to forget, at least momentarily, some of the horrible things he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s done, even if the revenge-minded Jim Moss (Robert Wisdom) can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t.\nHader (who directed every episode) also excels at darkly comic visual gags, which are augmented in the new season with a few hysterical cameos by actual Hollywood figures, among them director Guillermo del Toro, made even funnier by how random they seem to be.\nThat said, the show\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s surreal digressions and detours into fantasy become more distracting, in a way that feels a little too precious at times. The saving grace, consistently, is the strength of the cast, even if prison creates impediments to their interactions.\nHBO made most but not all of the season available, and the series effectively keeps the audience on edge and guessing about where it will all end up, and how (or if) its various threads will connect.\nThe likelihood of a happy ending for everyone in \u201a\u00c4\u00faBarry\u201a\u00c4\u00f9-land never seemed to be in the cards, but Hader and co-creator Alec Berg appear determined to exit on their own terms, as good (mostly) and sporadically frustrating as that might be. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s why it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hard to get mad at a show that takes such bracing creative risks, even with a season that isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t quite the stone-cold killer that it has been.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faBarry\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 begins its fourth and final season April 14 at 10 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros.

In 2019,\nAxios reported\nthat Trump had said self-driving cars \u201cwill never work,\u201d and was distrustful, despite his Transportation Department\u2019s enthusiasm.\nAdvertisement\nIt\u2019s unclear what stance his potential future administration would take on the technology, but his latest comments come as Tesla\u2019s (\nTSLA\n) robotaxi launch event is on the horizon. Musk \u2014 who has\nendorsed Trump\n, openly discussed a\npotential role\nin a Trump White House, and recently appeared alongside the former president at a rally \u2014 is hosting the  \u201cWe, Robot\u201d event in California late on Thursday night, with the goal of showing off Tesla\u2019s AV capabilities.\nAdvertisement\nMusk has\npitched his vision\nfor a robotaxi network as a \u201ccombination of Airbnb and Uber,\u201d since owners can opt their cars into the service at their leisure. An eventual fleet could, according to some of the\nmost bullish estimates\n, account for as much as 90% of Tesla\u2019s value by 2029, as long as it can take off in the coming years.\nTesla, to an extent, is already playing catch-up to some domestic rivals who have been testing more advanced technology for years, such as Google\u2019s Waymo (\nGOOGL\n).

That includes major players like Baidu, Didi Chuxing, and some smaller startups, the South China Morning Post\nreported\nearlier this month.\nAdvertisement\nThe total distance driven by Chinese autonomous cars in AV-friendly California fell by almost 74% in the 12 months leading up to November 2023, the Post reported, citing state data. President Joe Biden\u2019s Commerce Department has also said it would\nban autonomous vehicle software from China starting in 2027\n.\nTrump on Thursday also\nrepeated\na number of claims about the auto industry, including an oil lobby-backed criticism of recent federal rules on tailpipe emissions. He also falsely suggested that the widespread adoption of electric vehicles would \u201cdestroy\u201d public roads and the electric grid, that gasoline-powered cars now produce \u201c\nvery little pollution\n,\u201d and attacked\nhydrogen-powered vehicles\n.\nAdvertisement\nThe former president and Republican presidential nominee also took aim at the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases, labeling it \u201ctax breaks for rich people.\u201d The industry is concerned that a potential Trump administration would scrap the tax credit, which would likely hurt sales at major automakers like General Motors (\nGM\n) and Hyundai Motor Co.\nMusk, who has also launched a\npro-Trump super political action committee\n, in July said getting rid of the tax credits \u201cprobably actually helps Tesla\u201d in the long term because its rivals \u2014 who control much less of the market \u2014 would be hindered.\u201d",

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency slapped a cease and desist order and a\n$450 million civil penalty\non TD Bank Thursday over its inadequate Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance program. And the Federal Reserve Board imposed a\n$123.5 million penalty\n.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe vast majority of financial institutions have partnered with FinCEN to protect the integrity of the U.S. financial system,\u201d said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. \u201cTD Bank did the opposite. From fentanyl and narcotics trafficking, to terrorist financing and human trafficking, TD Bank\u2019s chronic failures provided fertile ground for a host of illicit activity to penetrate our financial system.\u201d\nTD Bank\u2019s U.S. business will also be subject to a $434 billion asset cap.\nIn addition to the monetary penalties, the Fed will require TD Bank to establish a new office in the United States dedicated to fixing these deficiencies and relocating its anti-money laundering compliance program to the U.S. The bank\u2019s compliance with the orders will be overseen by Canada\u2019s Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions.\nAdvertisement\nSen. Elizabeth Warren criticized the agreement in a post on\nX\n(formerly Twitter) Thursday. \u201cThis settlement lets bank executives off the hook for allowing TD to be used as a criminal slush fund,\u201d Warren said.\nTD Bank has a significant U.S. presence, with more than 1,100 locations across the country. It\u2019s the seventh-largest U.S. bank by deposits and the tenth-largest by total assets.\nAdvertisement\nThe\nU.S. Bank Secrecy Act\nwas created in 1970 to regulate how financial institutions detect and prevent money laundering through their systems, also known as\nAnti-Money Laundering laws, or AML\n.

Some of the most recent\nestimates\nhave come from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which expects a Trump presidency to add around $7.5 trillion to the federal debt, while others can go to as high as $10 trillion over 10 years.\nAdvertisement\nThe non-profit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that Trump\u2019s policies would give the richest 5% of Americans a tax cut of between $7,200 and $36,300, while the rest of the country would see their taxes increase by between $790 and $1,790 per year. However, the think tank\u2019s estimates did not account for Trump\u2019s recent flip-flop on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction.\nHere\u2019s what the former president is promising voters.\nA bid to overseas voters\nTrump\u2019s latest tax promise is an end to the \u201cdouble taxation\u201d of Americans living overseas, referring to the U.S. citizens who have to file their taxes both with the Internal Revenue Service and foreign governments.\nAdvertisement\nThat can result in them paying taxes both in the U.S. and in their country of residence unless there\u2019s a double tax agreement between that nation and the U.S. Dozens of countries ranging from Canada and Egypt to Luxembourg and Venezuela have such tax treaties with the U.S., which can provide reduced rates and exemptions,\naccording to the IRS\n.\nCitizens living abroad also don\u2019t owe taxes on the first $126,500 they earn while living out of the U.S. and can receive some tax credits. Most tax treaties have a \u201csaving clause,\u201d which prevents U.S. citizens or residents from avoiding paying taxes on income sourced from the U.S.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to the Federal Voting Assistance Program, 4.4 million U.S. citizens live overseas and 2.8 million can vote,\nalthough just 3.4% voted in the 2022 midterm election\nand\n7.8%\nvoted in the 2020 presidential election. Roughly 1.6 million overseas voters are from crucial swing states such as Arizona and Pennsylvania,\nCBS News reported\nin August, citing a Democratic National Committee voter outreach campaign.\nNo tax on tips or overtime\nOne of Trump\u2019s first tax-related proposals was to eliminate the federal tax on tipped wages, although such an act\u2019s effects would likely be scattered.\nAdvertisement\nFor starters, many workers receive tips in cash,\nmuch of which\nis never reported to the Internal Revenue Service. And, many of the roughly 4 million workers in tipped occupations already pay zero federal income tax. Thirty-seven percent of tipped workers paid no federal income tax in 2022 \u2014 before accounting for tax credits \u2014 compared to 16% of workers in non-tipping jobs.\nThat\u2019s because their pay is already lower than average; The median weekly wage for tipped workers was $538 in 2023, almost half the $1,000 median weekly wage for people who worked jobs without tips. The workers more likely to benefit would be those few working at high-end restaurants or other establishments who interact with wealthier clients more likely to spend more and \u2014\nsometimes\n\u2014 tip more.\nAdvertisement\nSoon after Trump first touted his plan during a rally in Las Vegas, rival presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris announced her own plans to eliminate the tax. However, her plan would also see the federal government eliminating\nsubminimum wages\n.\nTrump has also promised to end taxes on overtime pay, announcing the plan at an Arizona rally last month as a bid to give \u201cpeople more of an incentive to work.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIn 2019, his administration\nraised the salary level for exemption\nfrom overtime pay to $35,568 annually from the $23,660 threshold. That move was criticized by labor groups who argued that it covers far fewer workers than a proposal made by Former President Barack Obama in 2015, which would have made almost 5 million more people eligible for overtime; Trump\u2019s made just 1.3 million workers eligible.\nTrump\u2019s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nThe Republican presidential candidate has said he will extend the tax cuts included in his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), including SALT, which he recently\nvowed to restore in a bid to win over voters in competitive congressional districts\n.\nAdvertisement\nTrump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, has\nfloated\nexpanding the Child Tax Credit to $5,000; it was doubled to $2,000 per child by the TCJA. During the pandemic, Congress expanded that allowance to between $3,000 and $3,600, but it lapsed in 2021.\nSenate Republicans in August blocked a\n$78 billion tax-cut package\nthat would have expanded eligibility for the tax credit and adjusted payments for inflation for the 2024 and 2025 filing years; Vance missed that Aug. 1 vote where his colleagues voted against expanding the credit by a 48-44 vote.\nAdvertisement\nAlong with expanding the CTC to $5,000, Vance has hinted that he would like to see an expanded CTC without income thresholds. Currently, single filers who make more than $200,000 or married couples with a combined income of more than $400,000 are not eligible.\nThe Harris campaign has announced its own plan to\nrestore the expanded CTC\nand make its benefits permanent, alongside a $6,000 tax credit for low-income or middle-income families within a newborn child\u2019s first year.\nAdvertisement\nWithout intervention by Congress, the CTC will regress to $1,000 per child by 2026 after Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts & Jobs Act\nexpires\nnext year. Expanding the CTC could \u201ceasily\u201d add between $2 trillion and $3 trillion in federal borrowing over the next decade, a senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget told CBS.\nNo taxes on Social Security\n\u201cSENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!\u201d Trump wrote in July on his social media platform, Truth Social, referring to the partial income taxation of Social Security benefits.\nAdvertisement\nRecipients of Social Security benefits must pay federal income taxes if their combined income is higher than $25,000 each year if they file individually, or $32,000 for joint filers, according to the Social Security Administration.\nThe former president has not offered up a way to replace that revenue, which helps fund the Social Security and Medicare Hospital Insurance trust funds.\nAccording to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\n, that would advance the insolvency of Social Security\u2019s retirement trust fund by more than one year and the insolvency of the Medicare Hospital Insurance trust fund by more than six years.\nAdvertisement\nEven lower corporate taxes\nTrump recently proposed slashing the corporate tax rate to 15% for companies that make products with American workers. He had previously advocated for lowering corporate taxes to 20%, building on his 2017 tax cuts that slashed the rate from 35% to 21%.\nAdvertisement\nAt a\nmeeting in June attended by top U.S. CEOs\n, including JPMorgan Chase (\nJPM\n) CEO Jamie Dimon, Apple (\nAAPL\n) CEO Tim Cook, and Citigroup\u2019s (\nC\n) Jane Fraser, Trump vowed to make the cuts permanent and to renew tax breaks for individuals and small businesses. Trump, in a further appeal to Wall Street, has also promised to reduce business regulations if he is elected.\nHarris has promised to raise the\ncorporate tax rate\nto 28% from its current 21%, keeping in line with the budget the Biden administration\nproposed\nin March.\nAdvertisement\nTariffs, tariffs \u2014 and more tariffs\nThe former president has also advocated for increasing tariffs on foreign imports, especially those coming into the U.S. from China.\nAdvertisement\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the Trump administration raised taxes on U.S. imports from China by more than 500%. Those goods represented more than a fifth of everything that Americans purchased abroad,\nQuartz reported in 2020\n. Prior to Trump\u2019s trade war, the U.S.\u2019s tariffs were among the\nlowest in the world\n, averaging at around 1.6%.\nTrump\u2019s latest bid to take on foreign trade is to raise imports on China\nby as much as 50%\n, to 60% in total, while adding duties of 10% against products from the rest of the world. His tariffs could, by some estimates, add between $1,700 to $4,000 in annual costs to the median family in America, according to\nPBS\n.\nAdvertisement\nTrump has said the 10% tariff on all products imported into the U.S. would protect American jobs and raise revenue to\noffset extending the 2017 tax cuts\n, which are set to expire in 2025 without Congressional intervention. Although analysts at Goldman Sachs (\nGS\n) are\nskeptical\nof the 10% increase, they expect him to \u201cquickly\u201d put new tariffs on imports from China and autos.\n\u201cHe\u2019s proposed\n50%, or sometimes even more, tariffs on China\n, and Americans, particularly lower- and middle-income Americans, depend on access to Chinese goods,\u201d Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz\ntold Quartz\nin August, adding that \u201cthose tariffs would create a significant increase in the cost of living, it would be a shock to the economy, and that inflation, in turn, would lead the Fed to raise interest rates.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nTrump has also floated replacing the income tax with tariffs. But, according to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, the individual income tax raises\nmore than 27 times as much revenue as the U.S.\u2019s current tariffs\n. To replace the $2 trillion of revenue generated by the income tax would require tariffs of almost 70% on all imports, although that analysis doesn\u2019t account for several factors like noncompliance, the foundation said.",

People are still worried\nExuberant investors are foaming at the mouth for a \"soft landing\"\nRelated Content\nThe Fed has moved on from inflation. People are still worried\nExuberant investors are foaming at the mouth for a \"soft landing\"\nAfter an initial downturn, however, these sectors tend to quickly rebound as rebuilding starts. This complicates the economic picture.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThat means it will be harder to tell if the economy\u2019s trend is changing in October and November, since monthly changes in upcoming data might be due to the storms or due to a change in the broader economy,\u201d Adams said.\nAdvertisement\nAs a result, the Fed will have \u201cless information than usual about the direction of the economy in the next few months,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat they do know is that inflation slowed before the storms hit, although core inflation continues to run hotter than the headline.\u201d\nThe consumer price index, a key inflation measure,\nrose 2.4% in September\non an annual basis, coming in slightly above the 2.3% forecast, the BLS reported Thursday. Both headline and core inflation came in hotter than expected on a monthly basis, increasing 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. Two hurricanes \u2014 Francine and Helene \u2014 struck the U.S. in September.\nAdvertisement\nHurricane Milton\ntore across Florida\non Thursday, with as much as $175 billion expected in damages according to one estimate by Jefferies (\nJEF\n) analyst Yaron Kinar.\nNatural disasters can put the central bank in a tough spot, as they produce opposing effects on the economy, Joel Myers, founder and executive chair of AccuWeather, recently\ntold the Institute for Supply Management\n.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cOn the one hand, the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to reduce inflation,\u201d Myers said. \u201cHowever, the storms cause inflation by increasing the costs of goods. On the other hand, the hurricanes are harmful to the economy causing some businesses to fail and others to struggle as a result of the disasters, so jobs are being lost, and people and businesses are facing a long tail of economic impacts from the disasters.\u201d\nGiven the temporary nature of these price shocks, the Fed will likely take incoming data with a grain of salt as it weighs the size of its next rate cut. The Fed\u2019s decision-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is set to meet next on Nov. 6-7.\nAdvertisement\nSo far, economic data has been promising. Analysts widely expect the committee to reduce interest rates by 25-basis-points. That\u2019s a more measured move following the Fed\u2019s\njumbo 50-basis-point cut\nin September \u2014 its first interest rate reduction in four years.\nHurricane Francine, which made landfall in Louisiana on Sept. 11, had \u201cno discernible effect\u201d on national jobs figures, the Bureau of Labor Statistics\nsaid\nin its monthly jobs report last week. The U.S. economy\nadded 254,000 jobs last month\n, blowing past economists\u2019 expectations. The unemployment rate also trickled down by 0.1 percentage point from August to 4.1%.\nAdvertisement\nBut potential early impacts of the storms are  beginning to show in some data. Initial jobless claims surged 33,000 to a\nseasonally adjusted 258,000\nfor the week ended Oct. 5, the Labor Department said Thursday. These larger-than-expected figures were likely impacted by Hurricane Helene, which plowed through North Carolina late last month and resulted in\nmore than 200 deaths\nacross the southeast. Workers furloughed as a result of\nthe Boeing machinists strike\nmay have also played a role.\nAnd there\u2019s still more key data to come. The Bureau of Economic Analysis is set to release the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index \u2014 the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation metric \u2014 on Oct. 31. This could capture the likely elevated prices paid by Americans in and around disaster zones. In August, the PCE came in at a\nlower-than-expected 2.2%\n, nearing the bank\u2019s 2% target.\nAdvertisement\nPrices tend to rise in areas where natural disasters hit due to surging demand as people stock up on necessities, like food, water, and gasoline. On Wednesday, the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\nwarned consumers\nabout  price gouging ahead of Hurricane Milton\u2019s landfall.\n\u201cAs Americans seek safety from natural disasters, we\u2019re hearing troubling reports of price gouging for essentials that are necessary for people to get out of harm\u2019s way \u2014 from hotels to groceries to gas,\u201d said FTC Chair Lina Khan in a statement. \u201cNo American should have to worry about paying grossly inflated prices when fleeing a hurricane.\u201d",

A\ntweet\nby the company on October 2 announced that the service would be free for the next 30 days \u201cfor those impacted by Hurricane Helene, or looking to support response and recovery efforts in affected areas.\u201d Except it\u2019s not that simple.\nAdvertisement\nRelated Content\nElon Musk's Starlink internet is going live in Indonesia\nStarlink traffic skyrocketed in Brazil this year\u2014for better or for worse\nRelated Content\nElon Musk's Starlink internet is going live in Indonesia\nStarlink traffic skyrocketed in Brazil this year\u2014for better or for worse\nAdvertisement\nThe Register pointed out that if anyone goes to sign up for the \u201cfree\u201d service, there\u2019re hit with a harsh reality: you have to pay for the equipment.\nBut try to sign up for the ostensibly \u201cfree\u201d service in an area Starlink has designated as a Helene disaster zone, and surprise: You still have to pay for the terminal (normally $350, but reportedly discounted to $299 for disaster relief, though that\u2019s not reflected in Starlink\u2019s signup page), plus shipping and tax, bringing the grand total to just shy of $400.\nAdvertisement\nNone of this was mentioned in Starlink\u2019s original tweet nor can it be found on a\nsupport page\ntitled \u201cHurricane Helene Relief\u201d though The Register mentions that an update was added after their article went up that lets customers know they have to purchase the equipment. What\u2019s worse is that this \u201churricane relief\u201d looks more like a new customer promotion than anything as The Register mentions.\nRead further into the details on Starlink\u2019s help page for Hurricane Helene, and one might think it\u2019s a ploy to bag new customers in far-flung places.\nAccording to the Starlink Helene page, new customers who qualify for free access will be automatically moved to a paid $120-a-month residential subscription tied to the location the terminal was set up for after 30 days.\nAdvertisement\nEven if you\u2019re a victim that happens to be an existing Starlink customer, if you want those fees waived, you\u2019ll have to file a waiver and then\nwait for it to be approved\n. And according to people on the ground, the Starlink service isn\u2019t that great. The Register spoke to one Kinney Baughman \u2014 a Helene victim who recently had his power restored \u2014 and he\u2019s seen the service first hand. Baughman pointed out the long delivery time for the equipment, which also might be impeded by road infrastructure that\u2019s out because of the storm. Baughman said by the time the Starlink equipment comes, power may already be restored.\nEven if the equipment comes before then, you still need power to use it, and thousands are still without power. Baughman called what Musk and Starlink are doing a play on people\u2019s emotions. \u201cWhen someone comes along and says I\u2019m going to give you free internet, people start going nuts. Starlink is pulling on the heart strings of people overwhelmed by disaster.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nA version of this article originally appeared on Jalopnik\n.",

However, if a drug is in short supply, it\u2019s not seen as commercially available by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This loophole has led several digital health companies to produce cheaper versions of brand-name weight-loss drugs during recent shortages.\nAdvertisement\nTirzepatide belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 treatments. These medications mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite and have become highly sought after for their weight loss effects.\nSoaring sales for these treatments have transformed Eli Lilly into the\nmost valuable pharma company in the world\n.

The policy change did lead to a modest price increase of about 3.7% for menu items, translating to an additional 15 cents on a $4 burger.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, the increase is significantly lower than\nindustry predictions\n, suggesting that many fast food chains absorbed the costs\nrather than passing them onto consumers\n, the study noted. It\u2019s likely that the price increases raised restaurant revenue, partly because fast food is \u201cprice-inelastic.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nA separate study published earlier this year found that fast food chains in California had actually been raising prices by\n7%\nin the six months leading up to the wage increase.\nThe new wage standard, considered to be the highest in the nation, affects approximately 750,000 workers, with around 90% previously earning less than $20. While such an increase might typically raise concerns about job cuts, recent research indicates that the policy did not lead to reduced employment in the sector. However, Pizza Hut (\nYUM\n) and a few other chains said they would\nlay off  workers\nearlier this year.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough the study highlights that raising the wage floor can lead to better pay without jeopardizing jobs, challenging the traditional narrative around minimum wage increases remains difficult, partly because state\u2019s have their\nown standards to consider\n. As California\u2019s Fast Food Council moves forward with future wage considerations, the success of this policy could serve as a model for other states aiming to improve working conditions while maintaining employment stability.",

This was the first full contract negotiation since 2008. Boeing\u2019s (\nBA\n) offer \u2014 which it had labeled its \u201cbest and final\u201d proposal \u2014 had included 30% pay raises for workers.\nAdvertisement\nThe union, however,\nslammed\nBoeing\u2019s offer as disrespectful. It has argued that its workers need a 40% wage hike to combat the cost of living, a return to the pension system it gave up in a 2014 deal, more input on product safety, and other benefits.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to take credit for very minor, very meager movement that wasn\u2019t really touching on the major issues in a way that we could even get that in front of our members,\u201d Holden said. \u201cThe areas where they didn\u2019t make improvements are glaring.\u201d\nHolden told Reuters that while some members were willing to vote on Boeing\u2019s proposal, the company had rescinded its offer. He noted, however, that the union feels \u201cstrongly that there\u2019s lots of movement that can be made.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\u201cUnfortunately, the union did not seriously consider our proposals,\u201d Boeing Commercial Airplanes head Stephanie Pope said in a note to employees on Tuesday, according to\nReuters\n. \u201cFurther negotiations do not make sense at this point,\u201d Pope added, calling the IAM\u2019s demands \u201cnon-negotiable.\u201d\nAs the strike continues, its economic impact grows. There\u2019s already some worry that it will impact\nthe November jobs report\n. In addition to the more than 30,000 workers who walked off the job, Boeing has\ninitiated furloughs\n. Boeing\u2019s issues \u2014 which began this year with an\nalmost catastrophic incident\ninvolving a 737 Max 9 jet that led to intense scrutiny of its operations \u2014 may also have\nrepercussions\nfor Boeing suppliers.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe recent hurricane in Florida and the Carolinas and the Boeing strike have the potential to weigh on GDP growth for the remainder of the year,\u201d Oxford Economics analysts wrote in a recent note.\nS&P Global Mobility (\nSPGI\n) on Tuesday\nestimated\nthat Boeing will incur a cash outflow of roughly $10 billion in 2024, partially due to the strike and measures taken to overhaul its manufacturing process, and issued a negative outlook for the company\u2019s credit ratings.

Records from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority show that in the last two years there have been 67 incidents involving trespassing, and since 2023 there have been 22 incidents involving unauthorized vehicles in the tunnels themselves.\nAdvertisement\nRelated Content\nElon Musk is now banning journalists and competitors on Twitter\nTesla's cars still can't fully self-drive through an empty tunnel\nRelated Content\nElon Musk is now banning journalists and competitors on Twitter\nTesla's cars still can't fully self-drive through an empty tunnel\nFor the unauthorized cars getting into the tunnels, the problem seems to be drivers who are confused, don\u2019t pay attention to anything, or both.\nOf the cars that slipped onto the property, all of them did so \u201cinadvertently,\u201d according to a convention and visitors authority spokesperson. Their drivers followed the Boring Company\u2019s vehicles \u201cbelieving they were accessing a ride-share pickup spot or entry to parking, and were immediately directed out.\u201d Only one such incident \u201cresulted in a tunnel intrusion,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nAdvertisement\nIn defense of the Loop, there really isn\u2019t a way for a driver to \u201cinadvertently\u201d get into the tunnel unless they were completely clueless. From my personal familiarity with the system, vehicles can only access the tunnels from above ground at two stations: the west station and the south station. The west station sits at a part of the convention center that can\u2019t easily be accessed by outside vehicles, as it literally shares an area with a loading dock. A fence with a closing gate and signs that say \u201cAuthorized Vehicles Only\u201d and \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d are posted.\nScreenshot\n:\nGoogle Street View\nAdvertisement\nIt\u2019s the same with the west station. While this station is easier to access from public streets, it\u2019s still gated and there are the same signs as the other station. One would have to ignore all these, as well as numerous Loop attendants and Loop signage, to drive into the tunnel.\nTo help with this,\nFortune\nsays Boring Tunnel has installed license plate readers that close the gate if an unauthorized vehicle pate is scanned. Another problem has been people in the tunnels themselves. One incident involved a skateboarder getting inside the tunnel, forcing the system to shut down while the man was caught and taken out of the tunnel. Other incidents were more\u2026unique.\nIn one case, two people were found sleeping in one of the tunnel stations located near one of the convention center parking lots. They were ultimately escorted off the property by Boring\u2019s security. In another incident, a man tried to remove a license plate reader at one of Boring\u2019s stations, and convention center security also escorted him off the property.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to the records reviewed by\nFortune\n, it doesn\u2019t look as if The Boring Company reported any of the trespassers to local police; Las Vegas Police confirmed to\nFortune\nthat they weren\u2019t aware of any trespassing incidents in the tunnels.\nNone of this seems as if it\u2019ll stop anything, though. Las Vegas officials still seem to be convinced that the Loop is a viable public transportation alternative. Earlier this year, Las Vegas City and Clark County officials\napproved the sale of more land\nin the city so the company can expand its tunnels. If it gets built out, the entire system will be 68 miles of tunnels connecting everything from the Vegas Convention Center to the airport.\nAdvertisement\nA version of this article originally appeared on Jalopnik\n.",

That can result in them paying taxes both in the U.S. and in their country of residence, unless there\u2019s a double tax agreement between that nation and the U.S. Dozens of countries ranging from Canada and Egypt to Luxembourg and Venezuela have such tax treaties with the U.S.\nAdvertisement\nSuch agreements can provide reduced rates and exemptions, although they can differ on the exact details, as well as what specific items of income are excluded,\naccording to the IRS\n. Many contain what is called a \u201csaving clause,\u201d which prevent U.S. citizens or residents from using the tax treaty to avoid paying taxes on income sourced from the U.S.\nAdvertisement\nRead mor\ne:\nDonald Trump wants to end taxes on overtime. What else is he promising voters?\nThe Republican presidential nominee\u2019s proposal is targeted at the millions of Americans who live outside the country and are eligible to vote in the presidential election. Roughly 1.6 million of them are from crucial swing states such as Arizona and Pennsylvania,\nCBS News reported\nin August, citing figures from a Democratic National Committee voter outreach campaign.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cFellow Americans living abroad, your vote is more important than ever,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cNo matter where you are, your voice can make a difference.\u201d\nHis comments were welcomed by groups like\nRepublicans Overseas\n, which said in a statement that it has been working for a decade on tax issues \u201cwreaking havoc on the lives of overseas Americans.\u201d Marylouise Serrato, executive director of American Citizens Abroad, told The Journal that the compliance costs for filing tax returns can often cost more than the actual taxes overseas Americans actually owe.\nAdvertisement\nThe proposal is just Trump\u2019s latest appeal to Americans that has involved cutting taxes. He\u2019s already advocated for ending taxes on tips, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits, as well as lowering taxes on corporations and extending his 2017 tax cuts. Excluding his latest proposal, Trump\u2019s tax plans would add\nmore than $9 billion to the federal debt\n, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",

An executive recently\ndescribed\nimplementing a \u201cdoghouse\u201d cost-cutting initiative.\nAdvertisement\nThe board is also expected to talk about its CEO\u2019s future, a few weeks after it was first reported that Chairman John Elkann had started searching for Tavares\u2019 successor. The 66-year-old executive\u2019s\ncontract is up at the end of 2026\n, although Stellantis is open to extending his tenure beyond that date.\nAdvertisement\nBoth Ellkan \u2014 who also serves as CEO of Exor NV\n(\nEXXRF\n)\n, Stellantis\u2019 biggest shareholder \u2014 and Tavares are focused on shoring up Stellantis\u2019 operations in the U.S., which is a major profit center. Sales in the market fell by 20% last quarter, with some brands reporting year-over-year declines of more than 40%.\nStellantis\u2019 performance in North America has been rough in recent months, plagued by big recalls, plummeting\nprofits\n, quality issues, and executive departures. Last month, the automaker\nslashed its full-year guidance\nfor adjusted operating income and expected industrial free cash flow, and it pushed up its timeline to lower U.S. dealer inventory to about 330,000 units.\nAdvertisement\nIn recent weeks, Tavares\u2019 leadership has been criticized by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union \u2014 which represents 43,000 Stellantis workers \u2014 and the U.S. Stellantis National Dealer Council, which warned \u201c\ndisaster has arrived\n\u201d at Stellantis. An heir to the Chrysler family\ndeclared his intent to buy the brand back\nfrom Stellantis and lambasted Tavares and other executives.\nThe UAW filed a series of federal labor charges against the automaker last month and alleged Stellantis has failed to keep the promises it made in its 2023 contract. At least two UAW locals have authorized a strike, and union president Shawn Fain will rally against Stellantis Thursday afternoon in Washington, D.C.\nAdvertisement\nIn turn, the automaker\nfiled nine lawsuits\nagainst the UAW and\n23 locals\nand denied the union\u2019s claims. On Tuesday, Stellantis said it was\ncontesting\na Denver-based local\u2019s authorization vote and file another two lawsuits against the UAW.\nAfter Tavares meets with Stellantis\u2019 board, he\u2019s expected to\naddress Italy\u2019s parliament\nabout his company\u2019s production in the country. Stellantis on Thursday said it ended the third quarter\ncontrolling\n17.6% of the European markets year-to-date, noting it was ranked in first in Italy with more than 31% of the market there.

The next major update came in 2020 when the CEO said a robotaxi would be unveiled in 2023 and enter production in 2024, which didn\u2019t happen.\nAdvertisement\nRelated Content\nAre Tesla robotaxis really coming soon? Elon Musk's lawyers don't seem to think so\nElon Musk has a new date for Tesla's robotaxi unveiling\nRelated Content\nAre Tesla robotaxis really coming soon? Elon Musk's lawyers don't seem to think so\nElon Musk has a new date for Tesla's robotaxi unveiling\nBut on Thursday,\nafter another set of delays\n, Tesla seems prepared for what Musk has called a \u201cproduct launch\u201d of the robotaxi. Whether or not it\u2019s a successful launch akin to the\n2012 unveiling of the Model X\nor falls flat like the infamous 2021 debut of Tesla\u2019s Optimus robot, which showed off a person\ndancing in a costume\n, is unknown to anyone without insider knowledge.\nAdvertisement\nThe \u201cWe, Robot\u201d event is scheduled to start at 10:00 p.m. ET/7:00 p.m. PT on Thursday at Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s (\nWBD\n) movie studio near Los Angeles. While the studio floors will be flooded with Wall Street analysts, Tesla influencers, and investors, it will also be\nlivestreamed on X,\nMusk\u2019s social media platform.\nAdvertisement\nHere\u2019s what you need to know.\nThe product(s)\nThe robotaxi, nicknamed the Cybercab, is expected to be Tesla\u2019s first car that doesn\u2019t require a driver. The Austin, Texas-based company\u2019s electric vehicles offer some self-driving capabilities through its\ndriver assistance software\n, but a driver is still required.\nAdvertisement\nTesla\u2019s software, Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Autopilot, has also been the source of controversy and many headaches for Tesla, ranging from long-fought\nlegal battles\nto accusations of false advertising. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nhas reviewed 956 crashes\nwhere Autopilot was initially reported to be in use. The agency has launched more than three dozen investigations into accidents involving Tesla\u2019s software.\nAccording to\nBloomberg News\n, the Cybercab is expected to have two front seats and two doors that open upward like \u201cbutterfly wings.\u201d That would line up with the\nconcept art\nfeatured in Walter Isaacson\u2019s recent biography of Musk.\nAdvertisement\nMusk has also teased that his team will \u201cshow off a few other things\u201d on Thursday, which has been linked by some to the three \u201c\nmystery vehicles\n\u201d included in Tesla\u2019s presentation at its annual shareholder meeting. Musk is also expected to discuss his firm\u2019s plans to develop and integrate FSD into its Semi truck, which has received a\nlimited release\n, Bloomberg reports.\nDeepwater Asset Management\u2019s Gene Munster\nsaid last week\nhe expects to see three vehicles, including the \u201cCybervan\u201d \u2014 a rumored autonomous passenger van \u2014 and the $25,000 Model 2, which has been\nreportedly scrapped\n. Munster expects to see a prototype of the robotaxi, along with previews of the other vehicles.\nAdvertisement\nPlaying catch up\nAlthough Tesla isn\u2019t exactly a stranger to\nartificial intelligence or autonomy\n, it\u2019s still going to be behind some rivals. Companies, such as Google\u2019s (\nGOOGL\n) Waymo, have been\noperating autonomous vehicles for years\n, gathering data all the while, often without the controversies that have plagued Tesla.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWaymo is already way ahead of them, offering thousands of autonomous rides per week in several major cities, and Amazon\u2019s (\nAMZN\n) Zoox is on schedule to debut next year,\u201d GraniteShares CEO Will Rhind told Quartz over email. \u201cIn the robotaxi space, they don\u2019t have the first mover advantage and that could be costly if it takes them a year or more to officially launch their service.\u201d\nTesla will also have to appeal to regulators and the broader public, which remains largely skeptical and even\nfearful\nof autonomous vehicles. Thursday\u2019s event will take place on a lot with private roads, which may partially be because Tesla has yet to apply for a deployment permit from Californian authorities, as GLJ Research analyst and Tesla critic Gordon Johnson\npoints out\n.\nAdvertisement\nOne positive for the company going into Thursday, as Tesla bull and Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a Wednesday note, is that it isn\u2019t exactly a slouch when it comes to collecting data. Tesla has more than 1.5 billion miles of FSD \u2014 a\nlevel 2 automation system\n, meaning that it is only partially automated \u2014 logged in its data centers.\n\u201cThere is clearly a number of hurdles and questions the industry/investors want to hear about including: insurance, cost of the vehicle, timing, regulatory approval timeline, and overall operations among other issues,\u201d Ives said of the event.\nAdvertisement\nThe business model\nIn June, Musk\npitched his vision\nfor a robotaxi network as a \u201ccombination of Airbnb and Uber,\u201d since owners can opt their cars into the service at their leisure. He also reiterated his pitch to Tesla owners that they can make money on the self-driving fleet while sleeping, as the company would call cars to pick up customers of its potential ride-hail service through an app.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI\u2019m highly confident that it will far exceed the value\u201d of the monthly payments customers may have to pay for their cars, Musk said at Tesla\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.\nTesla will take part of the revenue earned from the potential service \u2014 which analysts say is likely years away \u2014 while the rest will go to owners. A timeline for Tesla\u2019s eventual network is unclear, and something investors will be hoping Musk elaborates on Thursday.\nAdvertisement\nJPMorgan (\nJPM\n) analysts in June said they don\u2019t expect\nmaterial revenue generation for years to come\n. Guggenheim Securities\u2019 Ronald Jewsikow\ntold Yahoo Finance on Monday\nthat a \u201creal credible path to robotaxi commercialization in the next 12 to 24 months is extremely unlikely.\u201d\nArk Investment Management has forecast a scenario where robotaxis account for 90% of Tesla\u2019s value by 2029, pushing the stock to as much as $3,100 per share. If a network isn\u2019t operational by that year, its\nprice target would fall to about $350 per share\n.\nAdvertisement\nArk CEO Cathie Wood earlier this week said she thinks analysts will have to positively revise their estimates for the robotaxi\u2019s effect on Tesla\u2019s profits,\ntelling Yahoo Finance she expects 80% gross margins\n.\n\u201cThis is not if, it is when for Tesla. And for Tesla, it\u2019s also how quickly will they roll out?\u201d Woods said. \u201cHow quickly will they go national, or even global, with their aspirations?\u201d",

Here's how\nBoeing's CEO is begging his machinists not to strike\nRelated Content\nBoeing can bounce back. Here's how\nBoeing's CEO is begging his machinists not to strike\nIn fact, it broke off talks with the union representing the workers, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, telling Reuters that \u201cfurther negotiations do not make sense at this point.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nAn earlier labor dispute this year between the planemaker and 125 unionized firefighters gave a sense that the company was gearing up to play hardball. After more than two months of the negotiations it\nlocked them out\n, an inverse of a strike where a company refuses to let its employees work until an agreement is reached.\nAdvertisement\nThe Associated Press reported that the firefighters\nratified a contract\nafter three weeks (and some prompting from President Joe Biden), but the machinist strike is much larger, disruptive, and has higher stakes \u2014 observers are expecting it to\ndent the November jobs report\nand\nweigh on national GDP figures\nfor the rest of the year.\nA pay dispute\nAfter months of negotiations, the company\nreached a tentative agreement\nwith the union in September for a contract that would see members get a 25% raise. Newly installed Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg\nbegged the machinists\nto ratify the contract and not walk off the job.\nAdvertisement\nThe 30,000-plus machinists had been negotiating their contract in full for the first time since 2008. The IAM seeking a 40% raise, though, so members rejected the tentative agreement and kicked off the strike \u2014 as they had promised to do in a 96%-in-favor authorization vote.\n\u201cWe walk the walk and talk the talk in the Labor Movement,\u201d the union\u2019s negotiating committee\nsaid at the time\n. \u201cWe stand on business, and now it\u2019s time to show them we aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nSome analysts had expected that Boeing would be facing as much as $1 billion a year in extra costs if it gave the union what it wanted, but paychecks aren\u2019t the only remuneration keeping the two sides apart. The union is also seeking\nthe restoration of its pension\n, which Boeing killed in 2014 in one of the contract extensions.\nBad-faith bargaining accusations\nAfter the first week and a half of the strike, Boeing sweetened the pot, teasing a 30% raise. There was a catch, though: The company said the bump was its \u201c\nbest and final\n\u201d offer. The union called that a \u201c\nblatant show of disrespect\n.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just because of how much the number fell short of the IAM\u2019s ask, but also\nhow\nit was communicated.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYour Negotiating Committee did not have any discussion or input on this offer,\u201d the union told its members. \u201cWe have said all along that the Union would be available for direct talks with Boeing or, at a minimum, expected to continue mediated discussions when the company was ready. These direct dealing tactics are a huge mistake, damage the negotiation process, and attempt to go around and bypass your Union negotiating committee.\u201d\nThe \u201cdirect dealing\u201d references to how Boeing publicized its offer, which the union said was an effort to cut it out from contract negotiations. That\u2019s\nforbidden under federal labor law\nbecause it undermines the collective bargaining process.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe first presented the offer to the union and then transparently shared the details with our employees,\u201d is how Boeing characterized it at the time.\nSince then, the company has also cut off the Boeing workers from their company healthcare plans.\nAdvertisement\nLast week, just before the most recent round of negotiations was announced, Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, the senior whip in the Democratic Party House caucus and the congressperson representing the district where much of Boeing\u2019s operations are based,\npushed the company\nto resume bargaining.\n\u201cI hope to see Boeing and the machinists come back to the table to work in good faith to address the issues of fair wages and pensions,\u201d she said.\nAdvertisement\nA recovery on pause\nIn the background of the strike is the ongoing fallout \u2014 primarily stemming from a door plug blowout aboard a 737 Max 9 plane in January \u2014 which has contributed to Boeing shares falling 40% this year. The incident, which prompted a great deal of scrutiny from federal regulators, hampered the company\u2019s efforts to come back from\nthe last 737 Max crisis\nwhen two Max 8 planes crashed months apart in 2018 and 2019.\nAdvertisement\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, which has\nramped up its oversight\nof Boeing\u2019s operations after admitting that it had been \u201c\ntoo hands-off\n,\u201d imposed a cap on the number of 737 Max planes the company can build. Even before the machinists\u2019 work stoppage, the company was bleeding billions of dollars at a time amid reduced deliveries.\nAhead of the strike, Boeing reportedly tried to\nspeed up production\nof some models using the same\nstop-and-start manufacturing methods\nthat it was trying to reduce in the wake of the door plug scandal. That\u2019s because the models produced by the IAM-represented workers make up\nnearly 90% of Boeing\u2019s commercial airliner order book\n.\nAdvertisement\nFor every day that its assembly lines are shut down, Bank of America (\nBAC\n) analyst Ron Epstein told Quartz that the company is likely\nlosing $50 million in cash a day\n, money it needs. Its investment-grade credit rating is\nhanging on by a thread\n; several ratings agencies putting the planemaker on watch for a cut to junk-bond territory. Should that happen, it would make Boeing\u2019s problems much more expensive to fix because its borrowing costs would jump.\n\u201cIf the strike goes beyond a certain point \u2014 I wish I could tell you, maybe a month? \u2014 the risk increases,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cIf you get beyond a month, things get more disruptive.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHaving initially figured that the machinists would get their 40% raise and get back to business as usual, he expressed surprise that Boeing is holding out for as long as it is.\n\u201cAt a point, they have to get back in the business of building airplanes,\u201d he said.",

        "full_content": "Photo\n:\nTA Ranch\nWhen travelers are exploring rural Wyoming, on the road between Mount Rushmore and Yellowstone National Park, they often stop at the TA Ranch in Buffalo, Wyoming, a Smithsonian Institute National Historic Landmark known for its horseback riding, connections to notable cowboys, and grand historic rooms.\nAdvertisement\nWhat they often don\u2019t anticipate, however, is what makes the TA Ranch so special.\n\u201cI think what people fall in love with here is the family feel,\u201d says Kirsten Madsen Giles, one of the ranch\u2019s co-owners. Three generations of the Madsen family have close ties to the ranch \u2014 and Giles says that they share those ties with some other entities that live on the property.\n\u201cMost people aren\u2019t even aware that we have ghosts. We don\u2019t want our guests to get super scared,\u201d says Giles. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want people ghost-hunting on my property. I don\u2019t want my ghosts disturbed.\u201d\nWhen Giles\u2019s parents purchased the property in 1991, it had fallen into disrepair, but they were determined to preserve the ranch due to its historic significance. The TA Ranch was the site of an 1892 siege during the Johnson County Cattle War \u2014 a dispute between cattle companies and alleged cattle rustlers \u2014 at the height of western expansion.\n\u201cThe Johnson County Cattle War concluded in our barn,\u201d Giles explains. \u201cThe cattle barons had hired an assassination force, and they were coming north to assassinate 70 men on a list. The citizens of Buffalo started riding south, and they took cover in the barn.\u201d\nIt was in that same barn, more than a century later, that Giles, her husband, and their son, had their first encounter with what seemed to indisputably be ghosts.\n\u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough how skeptical we were before we got here,\u201d she says.\nBut after decades of running the ranch and hotel, the family is convinced that mischievous cowboys still reside on their property. Sometimes they seem to tease her family or the hotel\u2019s staff: They\u2019ll cause loud noises or knock things off shelves. Giles says that in some instances the spirits will also make themselves known to the guests.\nWhile the Madsens don\u2019t advertise their ranch as a haunted hotel, they view the ghosts as an indispensable part of their property\u2019s history and as members of their own family.\n\u201cOne thing that we\u2019ve realized is that ghosts are people too,\u201d says Giles. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that we\u2019re working with people who have a hilarious sense of humor. Had we known them in life, we would have gotten along very well.\u201d\nContinue reading to learn more about luxurious hotels that are said to be haunted by supernatural entities.",

The FTC says it was a scam\nRelated Content\nWhat the blocked Penguin and Simon & Schuster merger could mean for the Kroger-Albertson's deal\nAn AI service promised 'the world's first robot lawyer.' The FTC says it was a scam\nThere were two giant oil-company mergers announced last year:\nExxon\u2019s $59 billion acquisition\nof Pioneer and\nChevron\u2019s $53 billion acquisition\nof Hess. Because of both deals\u2019 size, they naturally drew scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which seeks to protect consumers from unfair business practices. In both cases, that meant the threat of too little competition and its potential effects on prices.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe heart of American capitalism is a simple idea: open and fair competition \u2014 that means that if your companies want to win your business, they have to go out and they have to up their game; better prices and services; new ideas and products,\u201d Biden\nsaid in 2021\nwhen he signed an executive order directing the federal government to \u201c\ncombat the excessive concentration of industry\n.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe Biden administration has moved to block deals it believes would pose a threat to consumers\u2019 wallets. In some cases, such as\nthe failed merger\nbetween JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines, the administration has done so successfully, winning praise from liberal legal minds.\n\u201cPresident Biden and his team from the outset undertook a fundamental rethinking of the role antitrust and competition policy can and should play in the American economy,\u201d said Bill Baer, the former head of Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division under Barack Obama,\nin a lecture\nearlier this year.\nAdvertisement\nConservative scholars have been less enthusiastic.\n\u201cUnfortunately, Biden antitrust has so far embodied the paradox of the new antitrust populism\u2014namely, fighting the disruptive innovation of dynamic competition in the name of promoting \u2018fairer\u2019 or \u2018open\u2019 competition, which nevertheless stifles innovation and distorts the competitive process,\u201d wrote George Washington University research professor Aurelien Portuese in\na 2022 issue\nof the George Mason Law review.\nAdvertisement\nFinding a balance between those two viewpoints is difficult. When it came to Exxon and Chevron, the solution was to let the deals go through \u2014 but not unscathed. In each case, the FTC allowed the respective companies to consummate their mergers but blocked the executives of the takeover targets from serving on their new corporate owners\u2019 boards.\nScott Sheffield, founder and former CEO of Pioneer, and John Hess, Hess CEO and the son of Hess\u2019s founder, received such penalization. The logic behind the decision, per the FTC, was that both men had communicated with the oil cartel OPEC in order to collude on setting crude prices worldwide. Both companies\ndecried\nthose\nallegations\n, but their blockages were the price their companies had to pay to avoid a bigger legal fight.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAmerican consumers shouldn\u2019t pay unfair prices at the pump simply to pad a corporate executive\u2019s pocketbook,\u201d Kyle Mach, deputy director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition, said in a statement regarding\nthe Exxon-Pioneer deal\n. \u201cThe FTC will remain vigilant in its enforcement efforts to protect competition in these vital markets.\u201d\nIn a similar statement this week, his boss, Henry Liu, said about\nthe Chevron-Hess deal\n: \u201cThe FTC will use all its available enforcement tools to protect competition in this vital market and help ensure American consumers benefit from lower prices at the pump.\u201d",

Brian Kemp visited Tuesday.\nAdvertisement\nThe chain also developed the Waffle House Storm Index, which was started after former FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate said, \u201cIf you get there and the Waffle House is closed? That\u2019s really bad. That\u2019s where you go to work.\u201d\nWaffle House has labeled Milton, a Category 4 storm, as a \u201cCode Red,\u201d which means the company has closed its locations in the path of the storm. A \u201cYellow\u201d rating means that the location will have a limited menu and that the area might not have power. A \u201cGreen\u201d index means the store is operating as normal.\nAdvertisement\nIn many hurricane-prone communities, people look at Waffle House\u2019s decision to remain open or shut down as a sign of whether they should evacuate.\nAdvertisement\nOne Twitter user in Florida\nwrote Wednesday\n, \u201cUpdate: all Waffle Houses near our house are closed. If you don\u2019t know, the one ironclad rule of hurricanes is if a Waffle House closes, s\u2014-\u2019s getting real.\u201d",

Amazon\u2019s clinical teams will manage the prescription review and packaging process.\nAdvertisement\nCustomers in major cities like Boston, Dallas, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and San Diego will soon have access to faster delivery of their medications.

Amazon plans to use its advanced logistics to deliver prescriptions within hours, which could increase patient engagement and adherence to treatments.\nCurrently, Amazon Pharmacy customers typically receive their medications within two days.

Amazon\u2019s digital-first approach, with its same-day delivery expansion, is one way the retailer hopes to address this growing gap.\nSince its launch in 2020, Amazon Pharmacy said it has focused on making it easier to get medications. John Love, Amazon Pharmacy\u2019s vice president, stated that through the expansion, the retail giant wants to \u201cre-envision\u201d and \u201cre-imagine\u201d healthcare delivery to meet customers where they are.",

Despite the increased demands, Huang believes the trade-off is worthwhile.\n\u201c[T]he quality of the answer is so much better,\u201d Huang said. \u201cWe want to drive the cost down so that we could deliver this new type of reasoning inference with the same level of cost and responsiveness as the past.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia\u2019s stock was climbing back toward its record high $135 close in June.

The four companies, commonly known as the \u201cBig Four,\u201d control\nover 80%\nof the cattle market.\nAdvertisement\nIf collusion is proven, the implications could be profound, according to Anat Alon-Beck, a business law professor at Case Western Reserve University who specializes in anti-trust law.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to Alon-Beck, producers might be forced to alter their pricing strategies and production methods, while retailers may face pressure to source meat from more diverse suppliers. It could also foster innovation within the supply chain, as businesses seek to navigate new regulations and consumer demands for transparency and ethical sourcing.\n\u201cThe ripple effect could be huge,\u201d she told Quartz.\nTransparency from the beef giants has been a top priority of\nregulators\nfor some time. In June 2020, reports emerged that the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) had issued civil subpoenas to the Big Four, seeking information on pricing practices dating back to January 2015.\nAdvertisement\nIn July 2021, the U.S. Senate Committee held a\nhearing\nfocused on competition in the beef supply chain, where it highlighted the struggles of family cattle farmers amid market consolidation. While farmers, growers, and ranchers have tried to challenge the meatpacking giants, they\u2019ve struggled to provide sufficient\nevidence\nof harm from the alleged anti-competitive behavior.\nSuch has been the case for Kroger (\nKR\n) and Target (\nTGT\n). Earlier this year, the retail giants expressed\nsimilar worries\nregarding increasing profits and beef prices.\nAdvertisement\nIt remains unclear whether McDonald\u2019s will succeed in its efforts. The chain, which has requested a jury trial, is currently pursuing unspecified monetary damages and a court order to halt the alleged\nprice-fixing scheme\n.\nOn one hand, if the fast food giant is victorious, it could lead to a more competitive market, allowing smaller producers to gain a foothold. On the other hand, if the lawsuit fails, it might embolden other monopolistic practices among the beef giants, Alon-Beck said.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, unlike family farmers, McDonald\u2019s name carries significant weight. With 13,000 U.S restaurants and 39,000 locations worldwide, the chain is a powerhouse in the food industry and its approach to the lawsuit could ultimately benefit the market and consumers alike, Alon-Beck argued.\n\u201cPeople care about where their food comes from,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they see manipulation it could drive a demand for transparency.\u201d",

Gas-powered vehicles made up about 95% of the automaker\u2019s total\n659,601 deliveries\nlast quarter, according to the company. About 32,100 EVs were sold between July and September, a 60% year-over-year increase.\nAdvertisement\nRelated Content\nGM swears it really will make money on electric cars soon\nThe US is floating new rules on auto emissions to boost EV demand\nRelated Content\nGM swears it really will make money on electric cars soon\nThe US is floating new rules on auto emissions to boost EV demand\nDuring his presentation Tuesday, CFO Paul Jacobson touted GM\u2019s ICE and EV inventory, saying the company\u2019s supply of EVs at dealerships was aligned with its goal of raising customer awareness. Jacobson, repeating a sentiment often mentioned by CEO\nMary Barra\n, added that buying an EV is different than purchasing an ICE, noting that the \u201cexperience\u201d of testing an electric car is instrumental in boosting dealer turn rates.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing vehicle turn rates improve as customer demand is increasing along with our higher production,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cBut this is not a victory lap. Make no mistake, it\u2019s actually quite the opposite. We expect the ICE industry to have a long tail, and it\u2019s going to be a significant part of our future.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nExecutives have\npreviously\nsaid the company will need to keep advancing its ICE segment as the EV market continues to develop. Barra said Tuesday that GM thinks its EV losses peaked in 2024, with Jacobson noting that losses are expected to decline to $2 billion from $4 billion in 2025.\nBarra said the company is on pace to produce around 200,000 EVs in North America this year, with profitability on a production basis this quarter; about 120,000 of those units have already been made. GM\u2019s guidance had called for between 200,000 and 250,000 EVs, which had already been lowered from 300,000 units.\nAdvertisement\nThe automaker said it would build a new battery cell research lab at its technology campus in Warren, Michigan. GM\u2019s next-generation batteries are projected to cut costs by about $6,000 per EV, according to Kurt Kelty, the executive overseeing battery development.\nAbout a third of GM\u2019s product capital budget is tied to ICE refreshes, of which eight SUVs are scheduled for in 2025. Each refresh is expected to\nboost profitability\nof those models.\nAdvertisement\nAnalyst feedback on Wednesday was mixed, with several analysts \u2014 like Berstein\u2019s Daniel Roeska \u2014 saying that GM\u2019s event didn\u2019t provide enough details. For others, like Wedbush Securities\u2019 Dan Ives, it reaffirmed their confidence that the company is \u201cmoving in the right direction\u201d heading into the next year. J.P. Morgan (\nJPM\n) analysts reiterated their overweight ranking of GM stock, citing its core ICE business\u2019s strength and the momentum of its EV business.",

A new HBO documentary claims it has the answer\nIf the documentary is to be believed, Todd was only 23-years-old when Bitcoin\u2019s white paper was released. This assertion raises eyebrows, as it seems implausible that an individual at such a young age could have spearheaded a financial revolution of this magnitude alone.\nAdvertisement\nRelated Content\nBitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto unmasked: Will HBO reveal who really made the cryptocurrency?\nWho really created Bitcoin? A new HBO documentary claims it has the answer\nThe crypto community is ridiculing filmmaker Cullen Hoback for producing a documentary\ncriticized for its lack of factual accuracy\nand its heavy reliance on suspense over substance. Many in the community feel that Hoback prioritized sensationalism rather than conducting thorough research, turning what could have been an insightful exploration into a speculative thriller.\nAdvertisement\nHoback is known for previously directing the documentary series \u201c\nQ: Into The Storm\n,\u201d which exposed Q, the creator of the QAnon conspiracy theory \u2014 a far-right political movement that emerged on the message board 8chan in 2017.\nAdvertisement\nWhat\u2019s in the documentary?\nThe documentary primarily delves into the\nwell-established history of Bitcoin\n, covering familiar ground that has been public knowledge for years. It revisits the origins of Bitcoin, exploring why it was created and how it evolved into a mainstream financial asset.\nAdvertisement\nIt\u2019s only in the final 15 minutes that the director abruptly shifts focus to Peter Todd, hastily suggesting that he could be Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin. This sudden pivot feels rushed and needs more depth to support such a bold claim, leaving viewers questioning the documentary\u2019s overall credibility.\nThe filmmaker supports his claims by recounting Peter Todd\u2019s background, including his early interest in cryptography, his association with Adam Back (a prominent Bitcoin figure whom Satoshi Nakamoto contacted), and linguistic similarities in spelling and grammar that hint at a Canadian origin for Satoshi. A central argument involves a 2010 forum post where Todd replied to Satoshi; the filmmaker suggests this was an accidental continuation from Todd\u2019s own account, rather than Satoshi\u2019s. Despite these assertions, the documentary falls short of definitively proving that Todd is Satoshi Nakamoto.\nAdvertisement\nPeter Todd laughs at the filmmaker\nIn the documentary\u2019s final conversation between Hoback and Todd, the latter laughs at the filmmaker, saying, \u201cI will admit you\u2019re pretty creative. You come up with some crazy theories. It\u2019s ludicrous.\u201d Todd then jokingly adds, \u201cBut I\u2019ll say, yeah, of course, I\u2019m Satoshi. And I\u2019m Craig Wright.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nCraig Wright is an Australian scientist who has consistently claimed to be Bitcoin\u2019s creator. Earlier this year, he was referred to British prosecutors for\nallegedly committing perjury\n.\n\u201cThis is going to be very funny when you put this into the documentary and a bunch of Bitcoiners watch it,\u201d Todd says in the film. \u201cI suspect a lot of them will be very happy if you go this route because it\u2019s yet another example of journalists really missing the point in a way that\u2019s very funny.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHoback asks, \u201cWhat is the point?\u201d\n\u201cThe point is to make Bitcoin the global currency,\u201d Todd says in the documentary.",

Timothy Walz held their first joint rally on the other side of the Phoenix metro area in Glendale.\nHarris told the raucous crowd\nthat Trump\nhad announced on Wednesday he would not debate her again, after their first meeting in front of ABC News\u2019 David Muir and Linsey Davis in September.\n\"Now, I think it's a disservice to the voters. I also think it's a pretty weak move,\" Harris said.\nOBAMA CALLS OUT \u2018BROTHERS\u2019 APPREHENSIVE TO VOTE FOR HARRIS\n\"But even if he will not debate, the contrast in this election is already clear. This election is about two very different visions, two very different visions for our nation. One is focused on the past, the other hours focused on the future, including being focused on the issues that matter most to working families across America, like bringing down the cost of living and investing in small businesses and entrepreneurs.\"\nIn an all-caps message\non Truth Social\n, Trump said he won the prior two debates \u2013 versus Harris and Biden \u2013 and added he accepted a Fox News Channel offer to debate Harris in September, but it was the vice president that time who declined to appear.\n\"JD Vance easily won his debate with Tampon Tim Walz, who called himself a knucklehead [in the debate]. I am also leading in the polls\u2026\"\n\"There will be no rematch,\" Trump went on. \"\nBesides, Kamala\nstated clearly [Tuesday] that she would not do anything different than Joe Biden, so there is nothing to debate.\"\nHarris also offered a public response to the wrath of Hurricane Milton, which made landfall on the gulf side near Tampa Bay and wreaked havoc across the state to the Atlantic Coast, where several fatalities were reported near Port St. Lucie.\n\"I know as you do that our heart goes out to everyone who has been impacted by these storms. Our administration has mobilized thousands of federal personnel across the region to work hand in hand with local and state officials to give folks the help they need,\" she said.\n\"I have spoken with state local officials, both Republican and Democrat, to let them know we will be with you every step of the way as you recover and rebuild.\"\nPROJECT 2025 REMAINS NONPARTISAN, TRUE TO 1980S GOOD GOVT INCEPTION DESPITE WIDE OUTCRY, KEY FIGURES SAY\nHarris was, however, rebuffed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who reportedly declined to take her phone calls amid the crisis.\nDeSantis told CNBC\nhe and President Biden had been in regular contact but that the vice president has \"no role\" in disaster recovery, and that up until this particular cyclone she had not reached out.\n\"She\u2019s trying to inject herself into this because of her political campaign,\" DeSantis said.\nAt the rally, Harris also said she was the first vice president to visit the nearby Gila River Indian Community and offered her support for former Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez in his congressional contest against incumbent Republican Rep. Elijah Crane.\n\"\nI strongly believe that the relationship between tribal nations and the United States is sacred. And, that we must and that we must honor tribal sovereignty, embrace our trust and treaty obligations and ensure tribal self-determination. And it is my promise as president of the United States \u2013 I will defend those principles always.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHarris also co-identified Trump\u2019s campaign plan with the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025, a connection the former president has long disputed.\n\"I continue to say I can't believe they put that in writing. You know, they published it, they found it, and they handed it out. They're out of their mind. And it is a detailed, dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president again,\" Harris claimed.\nResponding earlier this year to Harris\u2019 claims about Project 2025,\nHeritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts\nsaid the characterizations were \"fact-checked\" by third-parties, including some \"so blatant that even corporate media outlets like CNN are calling out her lies.\"\n\"She has no policy record to run on, except her shambolic tenure as border czar,\" Roberts told Fox News Digital at the time.\nIn Arizona, Harris continued her focus on Trump, calling him an \"unserious man\" and saying his return to the White House would result in \"brutally serious\" consequences.",

        "full_content": "PITTSBURGH, PA - On the campaign trail for the first time for\nVice President Kamala Harris\n, former President Barack Obama repeatedly took aim at former President Trump on Thursday at a large rally in Pennsylvania, arguably the most important battleground state in the 2024 election.\nPointing to the margin-of-error race between Harris and Trump with less than four weeks to go until Election Day and early voting already underway across much of the country, Obama acknowledged that \"this election\u2019s going to be tight, because there are a lot of Americans who are still struggling out there.\"\n\"What I cannot understand is how anyone would think that\nDonald Trump\nwill shake things up in a way that\u2019s good for you Pennsylvania,\" the former president emphasized, to cheers from the crowd.\nObama, referring to polls that indicate many Americans think the economy was better during Trump\u2019s four years in the White House than under the current administration, claimed that \"the reason some people think\" times were better was \"because it was my economy. We had 75 straight months of job growth that I handed over to him. It wasn\u2019t something that he did.\"\nTRUMP AND BIDEN TRADE FIRE AS POLITICAL STORM OVER HURRICANE RAGES\n\"Just in case everybody has a hazy memory\u2026 he didn\u2019t do nothing except those big tax cuts,\" which Obama argued only benefited wealthy Americans and big businesses.\nObama, who remains extremely popular with Democrats eight years after leaving the White House, argued that \"there is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anybody but himself.\"\nAnd he reiterated that \"Donald Trump is a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago.\"\nCHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE 2024 ELECTION\nObama jabbed\nat Trump for his constant attempts to \"sell you stuff. Who does that? Selling you gold sneakers and a $100,000 watch and most recently a Trump bible\u2026. you could not make this stuff up. If you saw it on Saturday Night Live, you\u2019d say \u2018well that\u2019s going too far.\u2019 Well, he\u2019s doing that. It\u2019s crazy.\"\nAnd Obama stressed that \"we don\u2019t need a president who will make problems worse to just to make his own political circumstances better. We need a president who actually cares about solving problems and making your life better and that\u2019s what Kamala Harris will do.\"\nDuring the rally, Obama also discussed manhood and had a message for male voters who may be attracted to Trump's perceived strength.\n\"Real strength is about helping people who need it, and standing up for those who can\u2019t always stand up for themselves. That is what we should want for our daughters and sons.\"\nAnd he emphasized that \"is what I want to see in a President of the United States of America.\"\nAsked for a response, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News \"If anyone cared about what Obama says, Hillary Clinton would've been president.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS\nThe choice of Pittsburgh as Obama's first stop was no surprise. It's the largest city and Democratic stronghold\nin Pennsylvania\n, which is the biggest prize of the seven key battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided President Biden's 2020 White House victory over Trump and will likely determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election.\nObama isn't the only former Democratic president to hit the campaign trail on behalf of the vice president.\nThe Harris campaign announced that former President Bill Clinton, a longtime Arkansas governor who later won election and re-election to the White House, will stop Sunday and Monday in parts of Georgia before heading on to North Carolina later in the week for a bus tour.\nIt's part of Clinton's efforts to court rural voters in the two crucial southeastern battleground states.\nObama and his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, officially endorsed Harris for president in July, five days after President Biden ended his 2024 re-election in a blockbuster announcement.\nThe former president made the case for Harris during a headlining address at the Democratic National Convention in August in his hometown of Chicago, saying she \"is ready for the job.\"\nHarris and Obama\u2019s friendship goes back 20 years to when they met on the campaign trail while he was running for Senate in Illinois. And Harris was an early supporter of his 2008 presidential campaign and even knocked doors for him in Iowa ahead of the caucus, the Harris campaign noted.\nWhile Thursday's rally was Obama's first appearance on behalf on the presidential campaign trail, he's helped raise $80 million for the Democratic nominee, including headlining a top-dollar fundraising last month in Los Angeles, according to Harris aides.\nObama aides and the Harris campaign say the Pittsburg rally is the first of numerous coordinated \"get out the vote\" stops by the former president across the country in the closing stretch of the 2024 White House campaign.\nThey add that Obama will also sign additional fundraising emails, record candidate-specific ads and robocalls for down-ballot races.\nHours before Obama arrived in Pennsylvania, Sen. Bob Casey became the latest Democrat in a key Senate race that could determine whether the party holds on to its razor-thin majority in the chamber to release a new ad featuring the former president.\nCasey introduced the former president at the rally, and the former president repeatedly praised the senator.\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub\n.",

        "full_content": "It\u2019s hard to understand the money when it comes to natural disasters.\nDoes\nFEMA have enough\nto respond? Will residents get money after their car, home, business, town are destroyed by floodwaters? Will Congress approve additional tranches of disaster relief \u2013 both in the near-term and down the road.\nSo, let\u2019s follow the money.\nREPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WITH NO GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, IT FEELS LIKE CHRISTMAS IN SEPTEMBER\nFEMA\u2019s coffers for \"immediate needs\" and the Disaster Relief Program (DRF) were nearly\nbone dry as Congress\napproved an interim spending bill to keep the government from shutting down in late September. Lawmakers awarded FEMA more than $20 billion to reload the DRF, which dwindled to around $1 billion and change in September.\nCongress restocked the DRF simply because it was prudent to do so. Lawmakers had to return\nto Washington\nin an emergency session in the late summer of 2005 to refurbish the DRF after Hurricane Katrina. Front-loading the DRF with $20 billion this year would be enough for FEMA to get through any natural disaster until Congress returned in mid-November.\nThat\u2019s why FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell signaled things were fine with money for FEMA.\nFor now.\n\"I have the funding and sufficient resources to support the ongoing responses to Hurricane Helene, as well as Hurricane Milton,\" said Criswell. \"We had thought that we would go into immediate needs funding in December or January. I need to assess that every day to see if I'm going to be able to wait that long.\"\nThis is why\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson\n, R-La., resisted demands to recall Congress to address the storms. President Biden, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre have insisted that Congress come back ahead of schedule. The House and Senate are on recess until after the elections in mid-November.\nRegardless of the severity of both storms, it\u2019s hard to envision a scenario where Congress returns to replenish FEMA\u2019s coffers. Yes. It\u2019s good politics for the President, Mayorkas and lawmakers in the affected areas and others to implore Congressional leaders to\nsummon the House\nand Senate back to Washington. It gives the illusion of exhausting all options. Plus, if Johnson or Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., don\u2019t call people back, those from the opposite party can suggest that they aren\u2019t responsive or taking the damage as seriously as they should.\nMoreover, it\u2019s probably not even necessary for Congress to come back into session until November 12th. The DRF is now well stocked. Only something as catastrophic as thermonuclear war could draw down the DRF to zero before next month. So draining the fund that fast \u2013 prompting Congressional action \u2013 is not likely.\nWhen lawmakers returned in a dramatic, emergency, witching-hour session in 2005 to replenish money for FEMA in the wake of Katrina, it did so with a skeleton crew. Only a few lawmakers showed up. Then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., approved the bill on the floor after a few quick remarks and \"unanimous consent.\"\nHOW US GOVERNMENT WILL DOLE OUT AID TO VICTIMS OF HURRICANES MILTON, HELENE\nThere are three methods for the House and Senate to vote. A roll call vote where each Member is recorded as yea or nay. A \"voice vote.\" That\u2019s where those in favor yell \"aye\" and those opposed shout \"nay.\" The louder side (supposedly) prevails. Then there is \"unanimous consent.\" That\u2019s where a bill comes to the floor and a Member simply asks to pass a bill (more often in the Senate). If all Members agree, the bill is passed. But if there is a single objection, everything stops. The bill is dead.\nApproving an emergency storm relief bill with a handful of people may have worked right after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. But American politics now occupies a very different galaxy than the one 19 years ago.\nIn late March 2020, Congress attempted to approve a staggering $2.3 trillion relief package as the COVID-19 pandemic burned across the planet. Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution says that a \"Majority\" of the House and Senate \"shall constitute a Quorum to do Business.\" But the House and Senate conduct business all the time without a proper quorum. It\u2019s usually not a problem so long as no one presses the issue.\nWhen the COVID bill hit the House floor, leaders insisted on social distancing. The aim was to approve the bill via unanimous consent or a voice vote. A formal roll call would require that all 435 House members come to the floor at once. Not an optimal scenario in the initial, dangerous days of the pandemic.\nHowever, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., wanted to \"make a point of order\" that the House lacked a quorum and demand a roll call vote. Even former President Trump torched Massie, tweeting that the Kentucky Republican was \"grandstanding\" and should be evicted from the GOP.\nFormer Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Md., presided over the vote. He quickly counted Members present. Both the majority and minority devised a way to bring a large number of Members into the House chamber to represent a quorum. Some materialized, spread out on the floor. Others appeared on the balcony of the then-closed public viewing gallery.\nFor Brown, that was enough. The quorum was present. He gaveled the bill to passage without a roll call vote.\nIn today\u2019s toxified atmosphere, it\u2019s hard to believe that lawmakers from both sides wouldn\u2019t protest if leaders try to summon the House and Senate back to Washington for an emergency vote, ala, Katrina. Even though it\u2019s disaster aid, some will carp about the extra spending. They might accuse leaders of trying to ram through the measure without enough vetting. The 2020 coronavirus package vote hints at potential problems unless all lawmakers are recalled to debate and vote on emergency spending.\nFORMER NIH OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF MAKING EMAILS 'DISAPPEAR' PLEADS FIFTH TO COVID SUBCOMMITTEE\nThen there is the question of offsets.\nRepublicans representing the path of both storms certainly want the federal government to send disaster aid to stricken areas. But deficit hawks will demand offsets before authorizing new spending.\n\"We should definitely take take it from other places that the government just doesn't need to be spending money in,\" said Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., on Fox. \"There are areas that our government is spending money in that we should not be. It's really just political pet projects.\"\nBut what one Member views as a pet project is essential spending to another. Congress will gore someone\u2019s ox if it takes this approach.\nAs we often say, it\u2019s about the math.\n\"Tell me where you can get the votes to do it?\" asked one senior House Republican source familiar with the spending process. \"That isn\u2019t going to happen. That never happens.\"\nThe federal government is already into Fiscal Year 2025 and there is no agreed-upon topline spending number. So that makes it harder to find offsets.\nSo the fate of disaster relief?\n\"This will just go on the credit card,\" said the source.\nHere\u2019s what to look for in the coming days:\nThere will be clamor for Congress to return to session. President Biden wants Congress to come back. Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution says the President \"may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them.\" However, both House and Senate are not in the proper parliamentary posture for a presidential recall. The House and Senate are not \"adjourned.\" They are technically \"in session,\" meeting at regular three-day intervals with only a Member or two present until after the election.\nAlso, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., intends to bring Criswell before his panel in mid-November for a hearing.\nFinally, Congress will struggle with refurbishing funds to the National Flood Insurance Program and helping the Small Business Administration have enough money to assist storm victims. Mayorkas said that he has always known the flood program \"to be in the red.\"\nThere\u2019s a lot of money to follow in the coming months when it comes to the dual disasters. Was it too much? Too little? Did they spend it in the right places? Was it spent quickly? Too slowly? And inevitably, lawmakers will find something which went wrong.\nThe storms may have passed. But storm clouds on Capitol Hill about the federal response are just brewing.",

Carville estimated that with Hurricane Milton dominating the news cycle, Harris only has about 20 days to amplify her messaging.\nJAMES CARVILLE SAYS DEMOCRATS TALK ABOUT JANUARY 6 AND 2020 ELECTION TOO MUCH, SHOULD MOVE ON\nAn anonymous Democratic strategist told The Hill that Harris is still \"fine-tuning her message\" way too close to Election Day. \"We are in the \u2018make the sale\u2019 phase of the campaign now. We\u2019re not still tweaking the message,\" the strategist pointed out.\nSome of the criticism from Democratic strategists also included suggestions the Harris campaign get more aggressive.\n\"They need to be sharp. They need to be aggressive. They need to stop answering questions and start asking questions,\" Carville insisted on Wednesday. \"I think she and the whole campaign need to be much more aggressive and much less passive than they are.\"\n\"In these campaigns, every time you clear a bar, the bar gets raised,\" added Axelrod. \"You have to lift your game and adjust your strategy.\"\nWith Election Day rapidly approaching, polling in three critical battleground states show former President Trump\nmaking gains, but the race still remains a toss-up\nbetween the two candidates.\nAccording to polling from Quinnipiac University, Harris is maintaining a 3-point advantage over Trump in battleground Pennsylvania.

Quinnipiac's Michigan polling last month had Harris leading by 5 points, while its Wisconsin polling had her at a 1-point advantage over Trump.\n\"That was then, this is now,\" said Tim Malloy, a polling analyst at Quinnipiac. \"The Harris post-debate starburst dims to a glow as Harris enters the last weeks slipping slightly in the Rust Belt.\"",

And so if we have a request, he said, send them his way, and he wants to help us get the job done. So I appreciate being able to collaborate across the federal, state and local governments and work together to put the people first.\"\nDespite those comments and others from DeSantis as well as other leading Republican officeholders in the storm-struck southeast, Trump has continuously slammed Biden and Harris.\nDESANTIS AND HARRIS TRADE FIRE OVER HURRICANE CALL\n\"THE WORST RESPONSE TO A STORM OR HURRICANE DISASTER IN U.S. HISTORY,\" Trump claimed in a social media post on Tuesday.\n\"The worst hurricane response since Katrina,\" the former president charged on Wednesday as he pointed to the much-maligned initial federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which was heavily criticized for being slow and ineffective.\nTrump, speaking at a campaign rally in battleground Pennsylvania, lobbed another political bomb at Harris, arguing that \"She just led the worst rescue operation in history in North Carolina\u2026the worst ever, they say.\"\nAnd the former president once again made false claims that FEMA diverted money intended for disaster relief and spent it on undocumented migrants in the U.S. as he turned up the volume on his inflammatory rhetoric over the combustible issue of illegal immigration.\nHEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS WEATHER UPDATES ON HURRICANE MILTON\n\"You know where they gave the money to: illegal immigrants coming,\" Trump said as the crowd of MAGA supporters loudly booed.\nHours later, Biden pushed back, accusing the Republican presidential nominee of leading an \"onslaught of lies.\"\nBiden charged that the rhetoric from Trump and other Republicans was \"beyond ridiculous\" and that \"it\u2019s got to stop.\"\nBut on Thursday at a campaign event in Michigan, Trump kept up the attacks. He praised southern Republican governors for doing a \"fantastic job\" reacting to the storms and argued that \"the federal government, on the other hand, has not done what you're supposed to be doing, in particular, with respect to North Carolina. They've let those people suffer unjustly, unjustly.\"\nHarris, in a Wednesday interview with the Weather Channel, also chided Trump.\n\"This is not a time for us to just point fingers at each other as Americans,\" the vice president said. \"Anybody who considers themselves to be a leader should really be in the business right now of giving people a sense of confidence that we're all working together and that we have the resources and the ability to work together on their behalf.\"\nTrump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt, responding to the criticism, said in a statement to Fox News on Thursday, \"is this the same Joe Biden who President Trump knocked out of the race with the most dominant debate performance in history?

However, officials have since clarified that he came to the U.S. via humanitarian parole and later applied for SIV status.\nAFGHAN NATIONAL CHARGED WITH ELECTION DAY TERROR PLOT REIGNITES VETTING CONCERNS\nHeinrich asked Mayorkas how Tawhedi was brought to the U.S. and about the screening he underwent. But Mayorkas said he wished to focus on the aftermath of hurricanes Helene and Milton. He was in North Carolina and participated in the briefing remotely.\n\"Over 200 people have lost their lives in Hurricane Helene. We have reports that at least 10 individuals have lost their lives as a result of\nHurricane Milton\n. And I'd be very pleased to answer your question in a different setting, but we're here to talk about emergencies and the support that we can deliver to people in desperate need,\" he said.\nHeinrich asked again, specifically asking why he did not have answers prepared, but Mayorkas said that was not the case.\n\"What I said is I'd be pleased to discuss this issue at a different time, but I am here to speak about disasters that have impacted people's lives in real time. And that is a subject that I am addressing today,\" he said.\nHeinrich followed up to ask again, but Mayorkas again declined.\n\"Jacqui, your persistence in questioning can be matched by my persistence in answers,\" he said.\nAfter the exchange, a senior administration official told Fox News that Tawhedi was screened three times. He was screened first to work security for the CIA in Afghanistan, then for humanitarian parole to enter the U.S. in 2021, when he was vetted and screened in a third country, and then for special immigrant status, for which he was approved. His status has not yet been finalized. Officials believe he was radicalized after coming to the U.S.\nThere is also no indication that there were any red flags that should have barred his entry at any point in the process. His alleged co-conspirator in the case entered the country in 2018 and also passed vetting to receive a green card.\nAFGHAN MAN IN OKLAHOMA PLOTTED ELECTION DAY TERROR ATTACK IN US ON BEHALF OF ISIS, JUSTICE DEPT SAYS\nThe U.S. brought in more than 97,000 evacuees during the evacuation in 2021, of which about 77,000 were admitted via humanitarian parole through a program called Operation Allies Welcome.\nBut the new case has renewed concerns about vetting in the program, which has been identified for years by the DHS internal watchdog and by Republicans in Congress. In 2022, the\nDHS Office of Inspector General\nreleased a report in which it said it found that officials \"did not always have critical data to properly screen, vet, or inspect the evacuees.\n\"As a result, DHS may have admitted or paroled individuals into the United States who pose a risk to national security and the safety of local communities,\" the report said.\nDHS OIG FAULTS AFGHAN VETTING, WARNS NATIONAL SECURITY THREATS MAY HAVE ENTERED US\nA Pentagon inspector general report\nthe same year revealed that at least 50 evacuees were brought to the U.S. whose information indicated \"potentially serious security concerns\" and that officials were unable to locate dozens with derogatory information.\nA 2024 report found \"vulnerabilities\" in the processes of two DHS agencies for resolving derogatory information. It also found that DHS did not have a process for monitoring the expiration of the two-year parole period and guidelines for determining \"re-parole\" for parolees are \"undefined.\"\nThe Biden administration has repeatedly defended the vetting process, arguing there is a multilayered process that includes classified and unclassified vetting, including against Pentagon and FBI databases as well as Interpol notices and other information.\n\"Afghan evacuees who sought to enter the United States were subject to multilayered screening and vetting against intelligence, law enforcement and counterterrorism information,\" a DHS spokesperson said Wednesday. \"If new information emerges after arrival, appropriate action is taken.\"\nBut the latest revelation has only fueled concerns from Republicans. In a letter to Mayorkas on Tuesday, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., said it was \"unacceptable that the Biden-Harris administration is precariously failing to take measures to safeguard U.S. national security by allowing alleged terrorists into the interior of the United States to plot terrorist attacks.\"\nFox News' Matteo Cina contributed to this report.",

Based on protected whistleblower disclosures, it neglected to transfer enough funds for HSI to reimburse its agents, calling into question the agency\u2019s ability to manage federal resources and raising major concerns,\" Grassley said in a statement. \"Congress and the American people have witnessed too many Secret Service shortfalls in recent months \u2014 they deserve answers, and it\u2019s Congress\u2019 job to bring transparency and accountability.\n\"\nWISCONSIN SENATE RACE SHIFTS TO 'TOSS UP' BY HANDICAPPER AS TAMMY BALDWIN FIGHTS FOR RE-ELECTION\nIn the Sept. 26 email from a DHS official, they revealed that \"we had over $371,000 worth of Jump Team Authorizations Fail last night.\"\nAccording to Grassley's office and the documents it has obtained, agents have been required to pay for expenses the agency can't cover. The senator noted that this would be in violation of the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits agencies from obligating or spending federal funds before they are appropriated.\nReimbursements to agents are also apparently being delayed, and employees are left with uncertainty about their pay.\nIn a Wednesday letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas; acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe; Patrick Lechleitner, the deputy director and senior official performing the duties of the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and Katrina Berger, HSI executive associate director, Grassley described that \"HSI agents are deployed, usually on very short notice, across the country on Jump Teams from as short as a few days for as long as multiple weeks, several times throughout the year.\"\nTRUMP, REPUBLICANS VENTURE TO BLUE AREAS IN WISCONSIN TO BOOST GOP TURNOUT\n\"The whistleblower disclosures further show that in some cases HSI agents have had to pay for their own travel expenses such as flights, food, rental cars, and hotels, and other incidentals, because HSI has delayed reimbursing agents for costs due to the Secret Service failing to transfer funds to HSI.\"\n\"If you have an explanation to add context to these emails, I welcome it,\" he told the leaders.\nGrassley requested additional information from the department and agencies, including documentation about the finances of HSI and its jump teams.\n\"DHS responds to congressional correspondence directly via official channels, and the Department will continue to respond to congressional oversight,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe Secret Service did not immediately provide comment to Fox News Digital.",

        "full_content": "Former President Trump\nis proposing that federal education dollars \"follow the student\" in his possible second term, while pushing his \"universal school choice policy,\" and stressing that he backs it \"all the way.\"\nThe former president championed\nschool choice\nlast week, making his strongest case yet for the movement on the federal level.\n\"We want federal education dollars to follow the student, rather than propping up a bloated and radical bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.,\" Trump said at an event in Milwaukee.\nTRUMP PUSH TO DISMANTLE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT MET WITH ENTHUSIASM IN HOUSE GOP\n\"If you want a better education for your child, Kamala Harris stands in your way,\" Trump said. \"Kamala and the Radical Left Democrat Party want to keep Black and Hispanic children trapped in family government. I think that\u2019s really the reason.\"\nThe former president said he believes school choice \"is the civil rights issue of our time.\"\n\"A child\u2019s fate should be determined by their love of education, by their parents, by so many factors. But it can\u2019t be determined by a ZIP code,\" Trump said. \"And no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government-run school.\"\nTrump\u2019s universal school choice would allow parents to send their children to public, private or religious schools.\nTrump\u2019s stance is reflected in the 2024 Republican Party platform. According to proponents of school choice, it recognizes a role for both federal and state governments in expanding tax credit scholarship programs and Education Savings Accounts, which currently serve more than a million K-12 students across the country.\nThe Trump campaign said school choice \"leads to higher graduation rates, higher parental satisfaction and involvement, lower costs, increased competition among schools, and higher reading and math test scores.\"\nAt this point, 11 states have universal school choice, and 32 states and Washington, D.C., have at least one private school choice program \u2013 but 18 states have none.\n\"Before President Trump took office, zero states had a universal school choice policy. Now, almost a dozen do, and it is in large part because of the voice and visibility that he gave to elevate the issue into the national consciousness during COVID \u2013 but even before that,\" former Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News Digital.\n\"There is an increase in the number and needs of American school children with respect to alternatives to conventional public schools,\" Conway said. \"There is an increase in resistance among Kamala Harris and Democrats to allow these types of alternatives \u2013 these types of options and choices \u2013 to be in the hands of parents.\"\nOn the other side of the aisle, Democrats are expanding their opposition to school choice, and teachers\u2019 unions rejoiced when Vice President Kamala Harris tapped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, dubbing the ticket as a major win for public educators.\nWalz is a\nformer teachers\u2019 union member\nwho has said he is opposed to the school choice \"agenda.\"\nMINNESOTA WALZ-APPOINTED BOARD REQUIRES TEACHERS TO \u2018AFFIRM\u2019 THEIR STUDENTS' GENDER IDENTITIES\nTeachers\u2019 unions pushed hard to prolong school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, with many districts shuttered for more than a year.\nFormer Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said Walz was a \"5-alarm fire for parents and students.\"\nAs for the Democratic Party platform, Democrats support all children \"no matter their ZIP code\" to have access to a \"quality public K-12 education and for college to be affordable for every American.\"\nDemocrats are looking to push federal dollars toward public schools in an effort to \"expand opportunities for higher education and job training.\"\nHarris' campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment, but her website lays out her plan to \"ensure parents can afford high-quality child care and preschool for their children.\"\nHarris also plans to focus on working to \"end the unreasonable burden of student loan debt and fight to make higher education more affordable, so that college can be a ticket to the middle class.\"\nHarris said she would work to \"scale up programs that create good career pathways for non-college graduates.\"\nBut Conway explained that parents are focused on having more of a role in their child's education \u2013 now more than ever.\n\"There is a continuation of the parent\u2019s rights renaissance that started during COVID and spilled over into 2021 and into Glenn Youngkin\u2019s election over Terry McAuliffe in 2021 and continues unabated in so many states across this country,\" Conway said, noting that since the COVID-19 pandemic, which shuttered schools at the request of the teachers\u2019 unions, there \"are a higher number of people running for school board, and you have more parents engaged in choices of schools and character of curricula.\"\n\"There is a need for a charismatic and compelling leader to take this on,\" Conway said, referring to Trump.\nBy December 2020, Trump signed an executive order to expand education opportunities for American children and families impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. That order offered flexibility to provide children with emergency K-12 scholarships to access in-person learning opportunities \u2013 an effort to provide an in-person learning option after prolonged school closures.\nThe Trump administration also invested nearly $1.5 billion in the development of public charter schools and, under his tax reform bill, made it possible for parents to withdraw up to $10,000 tax-free per year from 529 education savings plans to cover public, private, or religious K-12 schooling costs.\n\"President Trump says this is the civil rights issue of our time, and it is true, but also, when you look at the sheer numbers of charter schools and school choice scholarship recipients and even the alternatives, like homeschooled students \u2013 and that is still a growing piece \u2013 but parents want to take things into their own hands. They know their children best,\" Conway said. \"If Trump is re-elected, this is going to be a biggie.\"\nAs for the word \"choice,\" Conway said the left \"wants to own that word\" but only when it relates to abortion.\n\"The Democrat Party really only wants to talk to women from the waist down, whereas, these parents of school-aged children want people to talk to them from the waist up \u2013 their eyes, ears, brain and hearts \u2013 and that includes them giving choices,\" she said. \"We should not be ceding the word \u2018choice\u2019 and the idea that women have a right to choose to the left based on abortion. It should be, women have a right to choose where their children go to school and what is taught there.\"\nBut Democrats believe school choice is anti-public schools \u2013 something Conway pushed back on \u2013 and argue that it would take funding away from teachers and schools themselves.\n\"It is just about competition,\" she said. \"You can customize your coffee 14,000 different ways at Starbucks. You can get Amazon to deliver anything to your home this afternoon. And yet, you are stuck with one choice for school.\"\nShe added: \"It is like shopping in a Soviet Safeway for your child\u2019s education, and it makes no sense, and it does not match the rest of the way we live our lives.\"\nThe Harris-Walz campaign did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.",

Ukraine has also suffered mass casualties, though the U.S. has not disclosed how many.\nUkrainian President\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy\nsaid in February that some 31,000 troops had been killed.\nThe U.K. Ministry of Defence put Russia\u2019s daily casualty count at\u00a01,271 in September, and said some 648,000 Russians had been killed or injured in the war.\nNORTH KOREAN TROOPS NOW FIGHTING FOR RUSSIA IN UKRAINE, SEOUL SAYS\n\"It\u2019s kind of the Russian way of war where they continue to throw mass into the problem, and I think we\u2019ll continue to see high losses,\" the U.S. military official said.\nSouth Korea\nwarned earlier this week that North Korea was sending its forces to fight alongside the Russians.\nRussia has also lost two-thirds of its pre-war inventory of tanks to Ukraine, along with 32 medium-to-large naval vessels.\nRussian President\nVladimir Putin\nis \"trying to avoid a mass mobilization because of the effect that would have on Russia\u2019s domestic population,\" the official said.\n\"At this point, he has been able to significantly increase the pay of these voluntary soldiers, and he has been able to continue to field those forces without doing a major mobilization.\"\n\"And I think we\u2019re just watching very closely how long that stance can actually be one that he can maintain, and I think it\u2019s an important one for all of us to watch very closely,\" the official added.\nFMR ESTONIA PRESIDENT TELLS US TO STOP BEING AFRAID OF PUTIN\nUkraine\u2019s military said it struck a base in\u00a0southern Russia\u2019s Krasnodar region storing nearly 400 strike drones on Wednesday.\nRussia has made some progress in the Donetsk region, taking the town of Vuhledar earlier this month and pressing toward Povrosk, a key railroad hub and supply station for Ukraine.\nThe U.S. official said the Russian strategy around Vuhledar and Povrosk had brought\u00a0\"substantial casualties\" for minor gains.\nRussia\u2019s Kursk region, which Ukraine invaded in August, is also in the midst of heavy fighting. Ukraine had hoped to divert Russian troops from the front line to defend Kursk. Russia has since recaptured some of the region, though the military official said that Ukrainian troops could hold onto the Kursk region for months or longer.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. continues to pour billions into Ukraine\u2019s defense. Last month, President Biden announced an $8 billion package for Kyiv to supply it with military equipment through January. It is the last of the $61 billion that Congress approved in April for Ukraine.\nDespite Zelenskyy\u2019s calls, Biden has resisted authorizing Ukraine\u2019s use of U.S.-given long-range missiles, known as ATACMs, to strike inside Russia and take out its stores of weapons capabilities, for fear of escalation.\nMany U.S. lawmakers have backed Zelenskyy\u2019s request, but the U.S. official said the Biden administration is not considering reversing its policy. He said many of the arms that Ukraine is looking to take out, like Russia\u2019s deadly glide bombs, have been moved out of range of ATACMs.",

DHS has been pushing back against claims online that it has diverted resources to illegal immigrants, that it is out of money, that it has been slow in responding and that it is blocking recovery flights.\nMAYORKAS RIPS \u2018POLITICIZED\u2019 ATMOSPHERE OVER FEMA DISASTER RESPONSE AMID GOP CRITICISM'\nFocus on the agency was fueled when Mayorkas said last week that FEMA does \"not have the funds to make it through the season,\" although he said it did have enough for \"immediate needs.\" The administration has pushed for Congress to return and pass a spending bill to provide additional funding for the hurricane season.\nBut the questions over funding led critics to look at the $650 million provided for grants to help illegal immigrants in the Shelter and Services Program (SSP). It led to accusations, including from former President Trump, that money that could have gone to disaster relief was being diverted. The administration pointed to the fact that the funding is congressionally appropriated and is separate from the much larger Disaster Relief Fund. But Republicans have still\nexpressed concern\nthat an \"entanglement\" in the border crisis has had a knock-on effect.\nSPEAKER JOHNSON RIPS \u2018LACK OF LEADERSHIP\u2019 IN BIDEN ADMIN'S HELENE RESPONSE: \u2018ALARMED AND DISAPPOINTED\u2019\nOthers have pointed to a possible political bias after an\n\"equity\" blueprint\nwent viral, saying, \"Diversity, equity, and inclusion cannot be optional.\"\nRepublicans have accused the administration of mishandling the response more broadly, with\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson\n, R-La., accusing it of \"egregious errors and mistakes\" and a lack of leadership.\nBut FEMA and DHS have been pushing back against numerous\nviral online claims\nthey say are false, including claims that FEMA grants must be repaid, that it is distributing aid based on demographic characteristics and that it is restricting airspace for recovery operations.\nPresident Biden has also slammed \"reckless, irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies that are disturbing people.\"\nOn Wednesday,\u00a0Mayorkas warned that misinformation can stop recovery efforts.\nTRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: \u2018INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED\u2019\n\"Historically, this country has come together as one in times of crisis, in times of disaster. We need that history to be lived today. We cannot have the irresponsible voices that actually wreak damage to individuals in need and prevent survivors from seeking the relief that is available to them,\" he said.\nHe had made a similar appeal on Tuesday night on MSNBC, speaking on the impact on the workforce and on the ability for individuals to get help.\n\"It is extraordinarily damaging. Most of all, it is extraordinarily damaging to the survivors of Hurricane Helene, of natural disasters. Individuals lose trust in their government, they are reluctant to seek the assistance that they need to meet their immediate demands \u2014 food, water, shelter. They don't seek it. They are entitled to it. They need it,\" Mayorkas said. \"We implore them to ignore the false information that is being spread and to seek the help that we have available to them.\n\"It is also extremely demoralizing to our federal law, our emergency response personnel, the state and local\nemergency response personnel\nwho are risking their lives in the service of those in need. When we reach into flooded zones, when we reach into a home that has been destroyed to assist another individual, we don't ask about their party affiliation. We are there to help, and they need to understand that. They need to trust us. They can rely on us.\"\nEarlier this week, Mayorkas warned that people \"are not seeking that relief because of the disinformation, the intentionally false information they are receiving.\"",

Hank Johnson\nre-introduced a death row appeals bill that would allow death row inmates the opportunity to introduce newly discovered evidence in their appeal.\nH.R. 9868, also called the Effective Death Penalty Act, was initially introduced in 2009 and later in 2020. The bill would amend a provision in the U.S. Code that currently governs circumstances under which\na state prisoner\ncan file a habeas corpus petition.\n\"We've got innocent people on death row right now with no opportunity to show compelling new evidence of innocence,\" Johnson said in a press statement released on Wednesday. \"The status quo is inhumane and unconstitutional.\"\nTEXAS DEATH ROW INMATE'S LAWYER SAYS 'THERE WAS NO CRIME' AS SHE MAKES LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE HIS LIFE\nUnder current law, a federal court cannot grant a habeas corpus petition unless the petitioner has already exhausted all state court remedies. This requirement was explained by\nthe U.S. Supreme Court\nin 1999, with the Court stating that such a requirement \"is designed to give the state courts a full and fair opportunity to resolve federal constitutional claims before those claims are presented to federal courts.\"\nThe bill would allow a death row inmate to not only introduce newly discovered evidence that \"demonstrates that the applicant is probably not guilty of the underlying offense,\" but to also raise an ineffective counsel claim on direct appeal. Some states do not currently allow for such a claim on direct appeal.\nThe added provision comes as a result of the 2022 Supreme Court case, Shinn v. Ramirez, when the Court held that a habeas corpus court may not conduct an evidentiary hearing or consider evidence beyond the state-court record based on an ineffective counsel claim.\nOKLAHOMA AG SUPPORTS NEW TRIAL FOR DEATH ROW INMATE WHO HAS HAD 3 'LAST MEALS'\n\"I believe we should completely abolish the death penalty, but while 25 states \u2013 half of which are in the South \u2013 still have some form of capital punishment on their books and some states like Alabama, Texas and Georgia continue to hold state executions \u2013 America needs the Effective Death Penalty Appeals Act to help wrongly convicted people on death row present newly discovered evidence that they are innocent,\" Johnson said in the statement.\nRep. Chellie Pingree, D-ME, Democratic House Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., are co-sponsoring\nthe bill.\nThe Supreme Court, which kicked off its new term earlier this month, heard oral arguments Wednesday on an appeal from\nOklahoma inmate Richard Glossip,\nwho has maintained his innocence in connection with a 1997 murder-for-hire of the owner of a motel he previously worked at. Glossip's initial conviction was reversed by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals after the court found he had received \"constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in numerous respects,\" according to the brief filed.\nGlossip now argues before the Supreme Court that he did not receive a fair trial as a result of the prosecution suppressing evidence of a key prosecution witness's testimony.\nJustice Neil Gorsuch\ndid not participate in hearing the appeal due to his prior involvement in the appeals process while serving on a lower court.",

        "full_content": "Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, remained silent Thursday on whether he still supports eliminating the Electoral College, after the Harris campaign insisted his position did not reflect that of the campaign's.\n\"I think all of us know,\nthe Electoral College\nneeds to go. We need a national popular vote,\" Walz said Tuesday during a campaign fundraiser at the home of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Walz made similar comments at an earlier fundraiser in Seattle, as well.\nWhile running for president in 2019, Harris said she was \"open\" to the idea of abolishing the Electoral College. However, according to campaign officials pressed on the issue following Walz's remarks, eliminating the Electoral College in favor of a national popular vote is not an official position of Harris' current campaign.\nFox News Digital reached out to representatives for Walz repeatedly to inquire whether he still supports replacing the Electoral College with a national popular vote, particularly after his campaign came out against it. A response was never received, but the Harris-Walz campaign did release a statement to certain news outlets suggesting Walz's remarks were intended to express support for the Electoral College process.\nIF 2024 POLLING ERRORS MIRROR THOSE IN 2020 ELECTION, TRUMP \u2018WINS IN A BLOWOUT,\u2019 CNN DATA GURU SAYS\n\"Governor Walz believes that every vote matters in the Electoral College and he is honored to be traveling the country and battleground states working to earn support for the Harris-Walz ticket,\" a Harris campaign spokesperson said in a statement sent to select media outlets like CNN and USA Today. \"He was commenting to a crowd of strong supporters about how the campaign is built to win 270 electoral votes. And, he was thanking them for their support that is helping fund those efforts.\"\nDebate over whether a national popular vote should replace the Electoral College surged in 2016 when Donald Trump won the Electoral College vote, cementing his victory despite losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. \"I think it needs to be eliminated,\"\nClinton told CNN\nafter her 2016 loss to Trump. \"I\u2019d like to see us move beyond it, yes.\" Clinton made similar calls earlier in her career as well.\nJust last month, Democratic Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin suggested there could be deadly consequences for Americans if the Electoral College was not done away with. Raskin said a national popular vote was a far better option than the current \"convoluted, antique, obsolete system from the 18th century, which these days can get you killed as nearly it did on Jan. 6, 2021.\"\nNEBRASKA GOP SENATOR OPPOSES ELECTORAL COLLEGE CHANGE THAT MAY HAVE HELPED TRUMP WIN RE-ELECTION\nThe Electoral College has been something that both\nRepublicans\nand\nDemocrats\nhave tried to do away with in the past, but contemporary calls for its abolition surged among Democrats after Clinton's loss. The process was established by the nation's Founding Fathers, seen as a compromise between the election of president by vote in Congress and election by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Electoral College votes, of which 270 are needed for any presidential candidate to win, are allocated based on the Census. The process effectively allows voters in states with lower populations to have a similar impact on the election as those voters living in higher population densities. The Electoral College is also thought to be a protective measure against super thin margins and excessive recounts.\nIn May 2023, as governor, Walz\nsigned a broad ranging election bill\nthat included\na provision\nto allocate the state's electors based on who receives the most votes nationwide, even if it doesn't match the outcome in their state. The measure, known as the \"National Popular Vote Interstate Compact,\" has been supported by 17 states and the District of Columbia, but will only take effect after all the states that have signed on have a total electoral vote count of 270. Right now, those supporting the reform only have 209, according to\nCBS News.\nPolling from the Pew Research Center\nreleased last month showed a majority of Americans favor moving away from the Electoral College. Since 2016, the sentiment has steadily increased, and, according to Pew, more than 6 in 10 Americans today prefer the national popular vote over the Electoral College.\nJason Snead, executive director of Honest Elections Project Action, a nonprofit that advocates in favor of retaining the Electoral College, argued Walz \"said the quiet part out loud\" when he insisted the Electoral College should be eliminated.\n\"Democrat leaders don't think they should have to campaign in places like Michigan and North Carolina, they want California and New York to decide every election,\" Snead argued. \"There is a pattern here. Democrats claim to love democracy, then set their sights on any institution that stands between them and political power: the Supreme Court, the Senate filibuster, and the Electoral College.\"",

Meanwhile, Gallego \u2013 a five-term member\nin Congress\n\u2013 appeared more relaxed, given his comfortable lead in several recent polls.\nThe two candidates sparred over border security and abortion in the first half of the debate night.

Gabe Vasquez, while enrolled as a college student at New Mexico State University, was the subject of a police report filed by another student that claimed Vasquez used the\u00a0\"telephone to terrify, intimidate, threat, harass\" him and threatened to \"kill\" and \"bury\" him.\nIn the February 2005 police report, obtained by Fox News Digital, Vasquez admitted to making a call that was construed as threatening but apologized and said, according to police, he was \"very upset\" over the condition of a friend of his who was suffering from alcohol poisoning on his birthday after being pressured to drink and later died.\nThe victim claimed in the police report that in addition to threatening the lives of the people involved, Vasquez used \"several bad words in Spanish.\"\nVasquez got off with a warning after promising not to contact the individual again and the matter was closed.\nANDREW CUOMO SLAMS 'DEFUND THE POLICE' MOVEMENT IN FIERY CHURCH SPEECH: 'DUMBEST WORDS EVER UTTERED'\nFox News Digital reached out to the individual who filed the complaint against Vasquez, but he refused to speak about the complaint and said they \"conciliated\" and \"went on with our lives.\"\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, Vasquez's campaign manager Dylan McArthur said, \"It\u2019s sad to see Yvette Herrell stoop as low as using a\u00a0close college friend's death from nearly 20 years ago to lie about the Congressman\u2019s character because she is trying to distract people from her horrible history of wanting to ban all abortion in the state.\"\nVasquez's interaction with the police was not the only time that he has had issues with law enforcement.\nThe year before, Vasquez reportedly had a controversial interaction in New Mexico when he was accused in a police report of using the \"n word\" while calling a former employer of his,\u00a0the\nWashington Free Beacon reported.\nVasquez denied being the individual who placed that call in a statement to the Daily Mail saying, \"I have not and would never use language like this, this attack is categorically false.\"\nBALANCE OF POWER: FIVE RACES THAT COULD DECIDE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE IN NOVEMBER\nPolice records, first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, also show that in 2005, Vasquez was arrested by the Las Cruces Police Department after neighbors called in a noise complaint. Vasquez is alleged to have attempted to flush marijuana down the toilet before his arrest.\nVasquez was also involved in a domestic dispute with his girlfriend in Las Cruces after an argument over her drinking too much, which led police to his home \"in reference to a possible domestic.\" Vasquez was not arrested in that incident, which did not include physical violence.\nIt has also been reported that Vasquez failed to appear in court in El Paso, Texas, in 2002 for driving without insurance and that a warrant for his arrest was issued in April 2008. That warrant was finally carried out in March of this year, resulting in Vasquez posting a roughly $900 cash bond and pleading no contest,\u00a0the\nWashington Free Beacon reported.\nVasquez is running against former New Mexico Congresswoman Yvette Herrell in a race the Cook Political Report ranks as a \"Democrat toss up.\"\n\"Threats to kill and bury someone should not be glossed over,\" Herrell told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"This is extremely dangerous and unhinged behavior from Gabe Vasquez, and he owes New Mexico\u2019s Second District an immediate explanation and apology.\"\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, Congressional Leadership Fund spokesperson Courtney Parella said, \"A disturbing pattern of behavior continues to emerge on Gabe Vasquez that is wholly disqualifying for someone in his position.\"\n\"There\u2019s no excuse in the world that makes it okay to harass, terrify, intimidate, and threaten another person\u2019s life.

You can count on my support,\" Vasquez wrote to a constituent demanding \"at least\" a 50% reduction of the Las Cruces police department budget.\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital in 2022, Vasquez said, \"I oppose defunding the police. As a Las Cruces Councilmember, I repeatedly voted to increase funding for the police and partnered with them, while supporting common sense reforms.\"\n\"Gabe Vasquez has a long track record of extreme verbal abuse,\" NRCC spokeswoman Delanie Bomar told Fox News Digital. \"Between calling a former colleague the n-word and now this, it's very clear that Gabe is not fit to serve in public office, and he does not represent New Mexico values.\"\nFox News Digital\u2019s Brandon Gillespie contributed to this report",

        "full_content": "HARI SREENIVASAN:\nPresident Xi Jinping opened China\u2019s twice-per-decade Communist Party Congress today with a lengthy list of his achievements during his first five-year term, and his vision of where he hopes to take his nation.\nBut beyond the words, Xi is asserting power like no Chinese leader in decades.\nWilliam Brangham reports.\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM:\nThe applause, the music, it was a reception befitting the commanding role that Xi Jinping has taken since being named party leader five years ago.\nHe opened today\u2019s proceedings by hailing reforms he\u2019s put in place, and proclaiming a \u2014 quote \u2014 \u201cnew era for China.\u201d\nPRESIDENT XI JINPING,\nChina (through interpreter): The Chinese nation has realized a great leap, from declining in modern history to twisting its fate fundamentally and continuously moving to prosperity.\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM:\nOver 3.5 hours, Xi laid out his vision to shape the nation of 1.4 billion people into what he called a \u2014 quote \u2014 \u201cgreat modern socialist country\u201d over the next three decades.\nPRESIDENT XI JINPING\n(through interpreter): Achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will be no walk in the park, and it will take more than drumbeating and gong-clanging to get there. The whole party must be prepared to make more arduous, strenuous efforts.\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM:\nSusan Shirk is chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego.\nSUSAN SHIRK,\nUniversity of California, San Diego: Xi Jinping has a vision of China\u2019s role in the world that is much more ambitious than anything we have seen before, talking about China kind of moving toward the center of the world and having a lot more influence than it did before.\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM:\nIn his address, Xi largely ignored the question of political reforms in China, and he didn\u2019t mention President Trump or North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\nBut in a rare move, he did acknowledge that with global demand weakening, there were challenges facing China\u2019s export-driven economy.\nPRESIDENT XI JINPING\n(through\u00a0interpreter):\u00a0 While China\u2019s overall productive forces have significantly improved and in many areas our production capacity leads the world, the more prominent problem is that our development is unbalanced and inadequate.\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM:\nXi was one of the first foreign leaders to meet with President Trump.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:\nThe relationship developed by President Xi and myself, I think, is outstanding.\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM:\nThat was decidedly warmer than Mr. Trump\u2019s past criticism of China and its economic and trade policies.\nBut other U.S. officials are more critical of Beijing\u2019s actions.\nREX TILLERSON,\nSecretary of State: China, while rising alongside India, has done so less responsibly.\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM:\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson today criticized China\u2019s aggressive displays of economic and military power, particularly its expansion on man-made islands in the South China Sea.\nREX TILLERSON:\nWe will not shrink from China\u2019s challenges to the rules-based order, and where China subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries and disadvantages the U.S. and our friends.\nSUSAN SHIRK:\nI think there are things to worry about in Chinese foreign policy that are mostly related to these maritime sovereignty issues and to a kind of bullying in Asia, but the global ambition could turn out to be positive.\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM:\nSusan Shirk says China has filled a vacuum left by the United States\u2019 withdrawal from global agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate accords.\nPerhaps the most important thing to watch for in the next few days is who Xi establishes as his likely successor.\nSUSAN SHIRK:\nThat is why there is a lot of speculation now that he may be trying, much like Putin, to stay on beyond his normal term or to rule behind the scenes even after he retires.\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM:\nPresident Trump will be traveling to Beijing to meet Xi next month.\nFor the PBS NewsHour, I\u2019m William Brangham.\nThe post\nXi Jinping celebrates China\u2019s rising power \u2014 and his own\nappeared first on\nPBS NewsHour\n.",

A security firm hired by the U.S. and Iraqi workers are making progress to clear major areas, but it could take years or even decades. Special correspondent Marcia Biggs reports on the safety of Mosul after ISIS.",
        "full_content": "HARI SREENIVASAN:\nBut first: The de facto capital of the Islamic State, Raqqa, in Syria fell yesterday to U.S.-backed forces.\nHowever, the largest city the militants once held was Mosul in Iraq. They were ousted from it in July after a brutal 10-month-long fight that killed thousands.\nNow a new major task: finding and destroying the ISIS mines, booby-traps and bombs that litter the city.\nSpecial correspondent Marcia Biggs reports from Iraq.\nMARCIA BIGGS,\nSpecial Correspondent: It was once a center of learning for over 6,000 students of technology, agriculture, and medicine.\nToday, Mosul Technical Institute\u2019s classrooms are burnt to the ground, laboratories reduced to rubble, and books charred and shredded. It\u2019s one of the city\u2019s five universities ravaged by the Islamic State and the battle to oust it.\nNow that the battle is over, a new danger looms, the trail of land mines and booby-traps left by ISIS.\nSo this is the wire, and this is where it was buried.\nCHRISTIAN,\nTeam Leader, Janus Global Operations: Yes, they would cut the asphalt, and then they lay the wire in and put the main charge here.\nMARCIA BIGGS:\nWe spent the day with Christian, a team leader from Janus Global, a security and risk management firm hired by the U.S. government to sweep and clear major areas of unexploded ordnance and mines.\nHe\u2019s not allowed to show his face or use his last name, for security reasons.\nCHRISTIAN:\nThere\u2019s actually two more on that road before we get to the target building that have to be excavated and/or rendered safe.\nMARCIA BIGGS:\nSo, the first building you have to clear, you have got to get rid of the IEDs on the road to that building?\nCHRISTIAN:\nYes.\nMARCIA BIGGS:\nIt\u2019s a long process.\nCHRISTIAN:\nIt is, but that\u2019s what makes it interesting.\nMARCIA BIGGS:\nThe United States has sunk $30 million this year into clearing former ISIS territories all over Northern Iraq. Under this program, Janus has already cleared 727 buildings, removing 3,000 IEDs, which they say ISIS was producing on assembly lines at an industrial scale.\nBut State Department officials and experts say the number of unexploded ordnance in Mosul itself is unprecedented.\nWhat\u2019s your first line of attack, in terms of trying to clear Mosul?\nCHRISTIAN:\nOur priority is more the community, rather than the individual, you know, infrastructure. You have got schools, power, sewer, water, so that the area can accept people back into it. And then, once this stabilization phase is over, we can move into the individual homes, so that they can be safer.\nMARCIA BIGGS:\nClearing Mosul is a process that they say could take years, even decades. So Janus is training local Iraqis to do the job, sending them out as a front-line search team, then investigating and removing any suspicious items themselves.\nCHRISTIAN:\nWe\u2019re not going to be here the whole time, so when we \u2014 it\u2019s our time to leave, they will have the capacity built from us, and the mentoring we have done, so that they can do it on their own.\nMARCIA BIGGS:\nHow are they doing?\nCHRISTIAN:\nThey\u2019re \u2014 a lot of them are very apt to learn. They\u2019re quick. They\u2019re smart.\nMARCIA BIGGS:\nFawzi al Nabdi is the team leader for the Iraqi local partner. He\u2019s cleared mines all over Iraq for the last six years.\nCHRISTIAN:\nWhat you got?\nFAWZI AL NABDI,\nTeam Leader, Al Fahad Company (through interpreter): We are ready for this, because it\u2019s my job and I love it. The Americans are here to complete our work and to help us. They have greater experience than we do. If we find any mines, we have to stop and they will investigate it and make a plan to remove it.\nMARCIA BIGGS:\nBut he says Mosul is the biggest project he has ever seen, and we\u2019re told it could take at least a month to just get the campus cleared of mines. Only then can they start cleaning it up, so that students can resume classes, this itself a huge task.\nISIS fighters closed the university back in 2014, and used it as a military base. As coalition forces pounded ISIS targets, this seat of higher learning became a battleground.\nGhassan Alubaidy is the institute\u2019s dean.\nGHASSAN ALUBAIDY,\nDean, Mosul Technical Institute (through interpreter): ISIS used our university to manufacture mines and bombs. For this reason, it was the target of airstrikes in the beginning. They struck the institute nine times, and they struck our workshops, too. Now we can\u2019t use them.\nMARCIA BIGGS:\nThe former commander of coalition forces in Iraq, Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, recently listed 81 locations where bombs were dropped, but had not yet exploded.\nFacilities used to make weapons were often on the list of high-value targets for the coalition. So now those places are twice as likely to contain dangerous items.\nSo, this was once a workshop for electrical engineering students. You can still see the lab tables here. It was hit by an airstrike in 2015. Afterwards, members of the university staff found bomb-making instructions among the rubble. This was likely an ISIS bomb-making factory, and judging by the crater, a high-value target.\nDespite the damage, Dean Alubaidy says he will hold classes this fall in alternate buildings, until the campus is ready. He\u2019s expecting registration to be in the thousands, students who lost three years of education during the fighting and don\u2019t want to lose another one.\nGHASSAN ALUBAIDY\n(through interpreter): On our Facebook pages, we found a great number of students posting that they were full of encouragement to come back. For us, it was unbelievable. We couldn\u2019t imagine it, to see how many students wanted to start again, how they were dreaming of the first day of classes, when they could sit in front of teachers again and start to live their lives again.\nMARCIA BIGGS:\nNext door, Mosul University has already started classes. Students even volunteered to help in the cleanup.\nBut across the river, West Mosul was the site of ISIS\u2019 last stand and bore the brunt of the battle. It\u2019s densely packed Old City, with its flattened buildings, is a challenge for mine-sweeping.\nFAWZI AL-NABDI\n(through interpreter): Most of the homes here were full of mines. And just here in front of us, a man with two kids came back to his home, and when he opened the door, the bomb killed him and his kids.\nMARCIA BIGGS:\nAhmed Younes fled back in early July with only the clothes on his back. Residents have been virtually banned from returning to his neighborhood on the outskirts of the Old City, but Ahmed said he got special permission, in order to retrieve some personal items.\nAHMED YOUNES,\nLocal Resident (through interpreter): We came on our own. We got permission to come, but they are not responsible if anything happens to us.\nMARCIA BIGGS:\nRight now, there is no plan to begin clearing the Old City or even to determine how many mines there are. It is still out of bounds to anyone but the Iraqi security forces.\nSo the Janus team is focusing on progress in the rest of the city, building by building, bomb by bomb.\nCHRISTIAN:\nWhoever made this device had a set goal. And to allow him to win, people get hurt. So you kind of compete against him to be better than him to take it out before it can do any harm.\nMARCIA BIGGS:\nSo, you feel like you\u2019re winning the battle against ISIS?\nCHRISTIAN: Yes, one IED at a time.\nMARCIA BIGGS:\nFor the PBS NewsHour, I\u2019m Marcia Biggs in Mosul, Iraq.\nHARI SREENIVASAN:\nTune in later.\nFrontline\u2019s latest film, \u201cMosul,\u201d was on the ground filming the fight as it unfolded street by street and house by house.

He pointedly criticized China, which he accused of challenging international norms needed for global stability.\nHe said the world needed the U.S. and India to have a strong partnership.

        "full_content": "JUDY WOODRUFF:\nBut first: Sunday\u2019s elections Austria were the latest ample of a shift to the right Europe\u2019s politics, as 31-year-old Christian Kurz was elected chancellor on an anti-immigration platform.\nHe may now form a government with a far-right party founded in the 1950s by former Nazis.\nThat follows recent elections in Germany, where a far-right party roiled the race and dealt a blow to returning leader Angela Merkel.\nIn Sweden, too, there is a strong challenge from the right and a neo-Nazi group that looks stand in elections next year.\nSpecial correspondent Malcolm Brabant ha been surveying the political landscape in Germany and Sweden, and he begins his report in Scandinavia.\nMALCOLM BRABANT,\nSpecial Correspondent: In a Gothenburg parking lot, supporters of the Nordic Resistance Movement form up for what they hope will be their biggest-ever march, to propagate an ideology espoused by mother of eight Paulina Forslund.\nPAULINA FORSLUND,\nNordic Resistance Movement: When white becomes the minority, they will be destroyed. I want my children to have a secure future. I want them not only for them to have a secure Sweden. I want them to have a secure world. And I want other people to fight for the same thing.\nMALCOLM BRABANT:\nWhen addressing her fellow neo-Nazis, Forslund\u2019s rhetoric sharpens.\nPAULINA FORSLUND\n(through interpreter): I\u2019m the welder\u2019s daughter, the forester\u2019s grandchild. My line consists of hardworking men and women. It\u2019s people like them we can thank for the welfare system that our lying politicians are now giving away to imported scum.\nMALCOLM BRABANT:\nClearly expecting trouble, the movement\u2019s leaders have a muscular protection detail, marching past a silent protest. The sign reads \u201cNo Nazis on our streets.\u201d\nThis protester would only give her name as Johanna.\nJOHANNA,\nAnti-Nazi Protester: They are racist people. They are people who think that certain people are better than others, and I will not stand for that. It\u2019s not something I think has a place in a modern society.\nMALCOLM BRABANT:\nExperts say the resistance movement is recruiting aggressively, and believe this demonstration is emblematic of the rise of the far right.\nIt took place on Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement.\nAllan Stutzinky is leader of Gothenburg\u2019s Jewish community.\nALLAN STUTZINKY,\nJewish Community Leader (through interpreter): Nazism has returned. The descendants of the murderers are organizing the same marches today, waving the same flags, shouting the same slogans, and have the same racist agenda.\nMALCOLM BRABANT:\nAnna Johansson is a member of the governing Social Democrat Party. It\u2019s considering outlawing the Nordic Resistance Movement.\nANNA JOHANSSON,\nSwedish Social Democratic Party: In Sweden and in Denmark, and in other countries, extreme parties are growing, and the hatred is spreading around.\nMALCOLM BRABANT:\n\u201cGo home to mama,\u201d he shouts. \u201cNazi pigs,\u201d chant the anti- fascist protesters, as a bottle flies through the air.\nDAMON,\nNordic Resistance Movement: If someone calls themselves a Nazi, most of us would dissociate with that person. That\u2019s nothing we stand for ourselves. I never call myself a Nazi. I\u2019m a national socialist.\nMALCOLM BRABANT:\nHitler\u2019s party was also called National Socialist, but Damon, a 40-year-old welder, insists he\u2019s a nonviolent family man.\nDAMON:\nThe demographic landscape of our \u2014 of the whole of Europe is changing, so, basically, it\u2019s a concern on preserving my heritage for my family and our kin.\nMALCOLM BRABANT:\nThis demonstration has been stopped short of its destination. The Nordic Resistance Movement is currently trapped between a line of police and anti-fascist protesters. And it looks as though this demonstration isn\u2019t going any further.\nViolence briefly erupts as the resistance movement tries to break through police lines, and several marchers are arrested.\nPAULINA FORSLUND\n: We are not your enemy. We are the government\u2019s enemy.\nThey say we live in a democracy, but we have never had an election about if we want to take all these people in.\nMALCOLM BRABANT:\nWhen Europe\u2019s refugee crisis began in 2015, Sweden copied Germany\u2019s open-door policy, and 160,000 migrants entered the country. Two years on, Sweden has tighter borders and has begun deporting some of the newcomers.\nThe new atmosphere alarms Floid Gumbo, entertaining an anti-Nazi rally.\nFLOID GUMBO,\nSinger Originally from Zimbabwe: I came to Sweden over 20 years ago. The climate in Sweden, the people were so friendly, and things were completely different, more welcoming. And I feel like things have sort of gradually changed.\nI\u2019m very concerned, because I have children, because I\u2019m thinking what I experienced here is not the same kind of climate, atmosphere that they are going to experience here.\nANNA JOHANSSON:\nIt\u2019s not so long ago that the Nazis ruined Europe. And that makes me very worried. The German elections were terrifying, I think.\nMALCOLM BRABANT:\nJohansson is referring to last month\u2019s success of the right-wing Alternative For Germany Party, or AFD, when it entered Parliament for the first time with 13 percent of the vote.\nHUGH BRONSON,\nAlternative For Germany Party: The AFD only came into existence because Merkel deserted the traditional conservative Christian voters. They were looking for a home, and the AFD has offered them a safe place.\nMALCOLM BRABANT:\nHugh Bronson is deputy leader of the AFD in Berlin.\nNow his party, the third largest in Parliament, is demanding that Angela Merkel imposes tougher immigration rules.\nYour opponents claim that you are a party of hate. What\u2019s your response to that?\nHUGH BRONSON:\nWe embrace foreigners who respect our laws, pay their taxes, send their children to school, and go about their normal life. The problem is with people who abuse the system to have a better life, or let others pay for their better lives, or who are criminals.\nMALCOLM BRABANT:\nOutside the opera house in Dresden, former East Germany, singer Luca Bergelt is dismayed by the political landscape shifting to the right.\nLUCA BERGELT,\nSinger: My fear is that they will tear Europe apart. They are going to raise up the walls again. They\u2019re going to build new walls between the countries, and that Europe will get more close into itself.\nMALCOLM BRABANT:\nAnti-immigrant sentiment is strong in Dresden. The city was the birthplace of a pan-European anti-Islamic movement, and it delivered the largest number of votes for the right-wing party.\nOn a holiday to celebrate German unification after the fall of communism, retired engineer Wilfried Schmidt explained why he sent a message to Angela Merkel.\nWILFRIED SCHMIDT,\nRetired Engineer\u00a0(through interpretor): Let\u2019s put it this way. We all need to recognize that Germany is undergoing social changes that are becoming harder to control. For one, there is mass immigration from difficult regions that is increasingly uncontrollable, of people with entirely different concepts of life, from fundamental differently structured societies that are problematic.\nMALCOLM BRABANT:\nAbout one million migrants poured into Germany in 2015. Chancellor Merkel consistently defended her pro-refugee policies, but now she has been punished by voters who believe she ignored their concerns.\nChancellor Merkel has promised to listen to the people who voted for the AFD, and she says she\u2019s going to try to win them over with what she calls good politics. But she will not countenance having the party in her coalition.\nBut the chancellor needs to find new partners who are prepared to be tough on immigration.\nAs she tries to forge a coalition, the chancellor has agreed to put an annual cap of 200,000 on the number of immigrants, something she previously refused to do. But will it be enough to woo back people who deserted her at the election?\nA question for Werner Patzelt, a political scientist at Dresden University.\nWERNER PATZELT,\nDresden University: Since Chancellor Merkel has made so many U-turns in German domestic politics, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if she would try to do a U-turn, also winning back AFD voters.\nBut this is a really hard political task, because so many of them are so much disappointed by the Christian Democratic Union in general, and by Chancellor Merkel in particular, that they will do anything to avoid going back.\nMALCOLM BRABANT:\nBack in Sweden, the governing party is horrified at the concept of conceding ground to right-wingers, and is trying to isolate them.\nANNA JOHANSSON:\nExperience shows that, when you adopt the ideas from these right-wing parties, they spread. These parties have their agenda implemented by other parties. And I wouldn\u2019t want to see that happen in Sweden.\nFLOID GUMBO:\nWe\u2019re all human beings. We share this world. We\u2019re all here. There\u2019s enough space for us all.\nMALCOLM BRABANT:\nBut that\u2019s an appeal that an increasing number of Swedes are rejecting, as the country and much of Europe go through a crisis of identity.\nFor the PBS NewsHour, I\u2019m Malcolm Brabant in Gothenburg.\nThe post\nFar-right groups gain ground in Sweden and Germany amid migrant influx\nappeared first on\nPBS NewsHour\n.",

        "full_content": "JUDY WOODRUFF:\nLongstanding rivalries were re-ignited in Iraq today between vital American allies.\nIraqi military forces and militia moved to push Kurdish forces out of the disputed city of Kirkuk in the country\u2019s north.\nLisa Desjardins begins our coverage.\nMAN\n(through interpreter): The commander in chief of the armed forces, Dr. Haider al-Abadi, gave orders to protect the people of Kirkuk and to impose security in the city.\nLISA DESJARDINS:\nAfter months of simmering tensions, Iraqi federal troops moved to retake the disputed city of Kirkuk from Kurdish forces.\nThe effort launched before dawn. By midday, Iraqi soldiers, along with state-backed militias, quickly took control of several massive oil fields north of the city. Iraqis also captured Kirkuk\u2019s military airport and various government buildings. They lowered what had been a symbolic Kurdish flag at the governor\u2019s compound.\nJournalist Rebecca Collard in Irbil was in Kirkuk this morning.\nREBECCA COLLARD,\nJournalist: You could hear some clashes, some gunfire in the distance, but for the most part, the city seemed more or less abandoned. Now, the Iraqi army, by the end of today, was essentially in control of the whole city and many of the outskirts of Kirkuk.\nLISA DESJARDINS:\nThe spokesman for an Iraqi Shiite militia said they achieved all their goals with little resistance.\nAHMED AL-ASSADI,\nSpokesman for al-Hashed al-Shaabi\u00a0(through translator): As the troops approached the area, they were confronted by some rebels, who tried to hinder the progress of the advancing units. Our troops returned fire and silenced its source.\nLISA DESJARDINS:\nThis comes three weeks after the Kurds held a nonbinding independence referendum that included the disputed province of Kirkuk.\nMore than 90 percent of the Kurdish region\u2019s residents voted to split from Iraq. The Iraqi federal government, Turkey, Iran and the U.S. all rejected the independence drive.\nThe multiethnic region of Kirkuk lies just outside of the autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq\u2019s north. Called the country\u2019s oil capital, Kirkuk produces around 500,000 barrels a day.\nIn 2014, amid the ISIS onslaught across Northern Iraq, the Kurds took control of Kirkuk, as the Iraqi military fled the city. In the three years since, the Kurds, led by their president, Massoud Barzani, sought to cement their hold, despite tensions with the central government.\nToday, Kurdish officials accused Iraq of carrying out a major multipronged attack.\nMAJ. GEN. AYOUB YUSUF SAID,\nPeshmerga Commander (through interpreter): I don\u2019t know what is happening exactly, because we have been in this fight since 4:00 in the morning. We have suffered casualties, including martyrs, and now we have withdrawn to this position. Some of the other Kurdish forces have pulled out. They didn\u2019t fire a single shot.\nLISA DESJARDINS:\nWhile Kurdish forces withdrew from posts south of the city, some residents vowed to die fighting. Thousands of others fled north.\nREBECCA COLLARD:\nFor the last few years, the Iraqi forces, these primarily Shia militia, the Hashed Shaabi, and the Kurdish forces have been focused on fighting ISIS. Now that fight is coming to an end, and what the fear is that now these internal division in Iraq are going to become more apparent and possibly more violent.\nLISA DESJARDINS:\nThese clashes pit one substantially American-armed military force against another. Both the Kurdish forces and Iraqi government troops are part of the coalition fighting ISIS. The U.S. sought to downplay the fighting, labeling the exchange of gunfire a misunderstanding.\nAnd, in the Rose Garden, President Trump tried to stay neutral.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:\nWe don\u2019t like the fact that they\u2019re clashing. We\u2019re not taking sides. But we don\u2019t like the fact that they\u2019re clashing.\nLISA DESJARDINS:\nFor the PBS NewsHour, I\u2019m Lisa Desjardins.\nJUDY WOODRUFF:\nFor more, I\u2019m joined now by Emma Sky. She served as an adviser to General David Petraeus while he was commander of U.S. forces in Iraq from 2007 to 2010, and by Feisal Istrabadi. He\u2019s a former Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations and he helped write Iraq\u2019s interim constitution.\nWelcome to both of you.\nLet me start with you, Emma Sky.\nThis has happened so quickly. What exactly has the Iraqi government done?\nEMMA SKY,\nYale University: The Iraqi government has deployed its forces back up north into Kirkuk.\nAnd since 2003, the Kurds have made it clear that they want to include Kirkuk within their territory in order to proceed with gaining independence, which has always been their goal. But Kirkuk is important to Iraq itself, and no Iraqi prime minister can afford to lose Kirkuk.\nSo you can see this reaction that has taken place following the referendum on independence, which happened September the 25th, and also included the disputed territories and the city of Kirkuk.\nJUDY WOODRUFF:\nFeisal Istrabadi, what can you add to why the Iraqi government is so set on taking over the city?\nFEISAL ISTRABADI,\nFormer Deputy UN Ambassador, Iraq: Well, a couple of reasons.\nFirst, as Emma just said, it is a part of the disputed territories, which are legally and constitutionally under the jurisdiction of the federal government in Baghdad. The KRG expanded into these disputed territories at the time when ISIL was expanding its territory, and then began to take steps to unilaterally declare that these areas were now incorporated into the Kurdistan region, including when it held the referendum that Emma talked about.\nIt included holding the referendum in these disputed territories. Now, so long as Iraq \u2014 so long as we\u2019re talking about a single country, it matters a little less who controls Kirkuk, but once the referendum was held, this gave rise then to the second reason for Baghdad choosing to act now.\nAs Emma said, Kirkuk is an important oil-producing zone in Iraq. And it is vital for the economic viability of an independent Kurdish state and an important part of the economic viability of the Iraqi state. So there was never going to be a scenario, I think, in which Baghdad would allow a unilateral exercise of control by Kurds to occur over Kirkuk, so long as independence is on the table.\nJUDY WOODRUFF:\nEmma Sky, we heard President Trump say today the U.S. is not taking sides in this.\nIs that accurate, that the U.S. isn\u2019t taking sides? What is the U.S. role here?\nEMMA SKY:\nWell, the U.S. has stipulated over and over again that its policy is to support a united Iraq.\nSo you can see the U.S. has given support to Iraqi security forces, but also to the Kurdish Peshmerga, to fight against ISIS. The U.S. policy for the last few years has really been focused on ISIS and not on the day after ISIS.\nBut what we\u2019re witnessing at the moment is that different groups are already moving to the day after, which is the power struggle for control of different territories in Iraq.\nAnd Barzani believed that during the fight against ISIS, he became stronger because he got weapons directly from the international community. And, as Feisal said, he was able to extend his control over the disputed territories.\nHe\u2019s also facing domestic problems within Kurdistan. There are tensions between the different Kurdish groups, and some believe that Barzani has overstayed his term as president.\nJUDY WOODRUFF:\nWhich reminds us just how complicated this is, Feisal Istrabadi.\nWhat does the Iraqi central government want here? They\u2019re not going to get rid of the Kurds. What is it that they want?\nFEISAL ISTRABADI:\nOh, well, I mean, the Kurds of course are a vital part of Iraq. They\u2019re a vital part of the political process, and they have been represented in Baghdad. The president of Iraq is a Kurd and has been since 2005.\nI think what needs to occur and I hope what the government of Iraq wants is a negotiated settlement, in which no party dictates terms to the other, but a negotiated settlement.\nLook, Irbil has some legitimate agreements with respect to Baghdad. Baghdad has some legitimate agreements with respect to Irbil. I think we need a mediator perhaps or somebody to convene a roundtable \u2014 the United States is who I\u2019m thinking of, of course \u2014 to address some of those issues.\nMost of the issues are, from the Irbil side, economic issues of payments, and from Baghdad\u2019s side, transparency of how much oil Irbil is producing and exporting, which Irbil has never accounted for to Baghdad.\nI think if those issues are resolved, perhaps hopefully some of these other issues can at least be delayed for another day. But at the end of the day, neither government \u2014 neither the regional government nor the federal government in Baghdad can really tolerate dictation of terms to it by the other side. My hope is that a negotiated settlement obtains.\nJUDY WOODRUFF:\nEmma Sky, where do you see this going from here? Do you see the peace that different sides have worked to hard to create in Iraq unraveling as a result of this?\nEMMA SKY:\nI think there is an opportunity for a deal, and I think the sort of deal that could be negotiated is one that looks at a special status for the city of Kirkuk and negotiated terms for Kurdistan\u2019s separate, whether that be towards confederation or towards independence.\nBut there needs to be negotiation. There needs to be a look at where should the border between Iraqi Kurdistan and the rest of Iraq actually be, and that requires mediation district by district through those territories.\nJUDY WOODRUFF:\nWell, we know there are other players who are playing an important role here in Iran and Turkey, and this is all very much playing out as we watch, watch it happen in Iraq.\nEmma Sky, Feisal Istrabadi, thank you very much.\nFEISAL ISTRABADI:\nThank you.\nEMMA SKY:\nThank you.\nThe post\nWhy a power struggle has broken out over Kirkuk\nappeared first on\nPBS NewsHour\n.",

He\u2019s not seeking to go to war.\u201d\nRecent mixed messaging from the top of the U.S. government has raised concerns about the potential for miscalculation amid the increasingly bellicose exchange of words by Trump and the North Korean leader.\nTrump told the U.N. General Assembly last month that if the U.S. is \u201cforced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.\u201d Trump also tweeted that Korea\u2019s leadership \u201cwon\u2019t be around much longer\u201d if it continued its provocations, a declaration that led the North\u2019s foreign minister to assert that Trump had \u201cdeclared war on our country.\u201d\nTillerson acknowledged during a recent trip to Beijing that the Trump administration was keeping open direct channels of communications with North Korea and probing the North\u2019s willingness to talk. He provided no elaboration about those channels or the substance of any discussions.\nSoon after, Trump took to Twitter, saying he had told \u201cour wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man \u2026 Save your energy Rex, we\u2019ll do what has to be done!\u201d Trump offered no further explanation, but he said all military options are on the table for dealing with North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.\nAnalysts have speculated about whether the president and his top diplomat were playing \u201cgood cop, bad cop\u201d with North Korea, and how China might interpret the confusing signals from Washington. Beijing is the North\u2019s main trading partner, and the U.S. is counting on China to enforce U.N. sanctions.\n\u201cRest assured that the Chinese are not confused in any way what the American policy towards North Korea (is) or what our actions and efforts are directed at,\u201d Tillerson said.\nAsked if Trump\u2019s tweets undermined Tillerson, the secretary said: \u201cI think what the president is doing is he\u2019s trying to motivate action on a number of people\u2019s part, in particular the regime in North Korea. I think he does want to be clear with Kim Jong Un and that regime in North Korea that he has military preparations ready to go and he has those military options on the table and we have spent substantial time perfecting those.\u201d\nHe added that Trump \u201chas made it clear to me to continue my diplomatic efforts, which we are, and I\u2019ve told others those diplomatic efforts will continue until the first bomb drops.\u201d\nNorth Korea has launched missiles that potentially can strike the U.S. mainland and recently conducted its largest ever underground nuclear explosion.

        "full_content": "HARI SREENIVASAN:\nThe desire of the Kurds along Iraq\u2019s northern border to govern themselves is receiving more resistance from Iraq\u2019s central government. Iraqi army forces are demanding Kurdish troops withdraw from oil fields and military bases around Kirkuk, a city in the Kurdistan region that voted for independence last month. Kirkuk also has 10% of Iraq\u2019s known oil reserves. Washington Post\u2019s Loveday Morris is in Baghdad covering this standoff joins me now via Skype. First of all the significance of this. Why is it so important?\nLOVEDAY MORRIS:\nThere\u2019s been a longtime conflict between Baghdad and Kurdistan over these disputed territories. Most significant of which is Kirkuk because of the oil reserves. But the referendum last month has really sharpened these disputes because you have Baghdad opposing independence and so it feels like they have to restate its territorial claims these areas. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing a lot of tension right now.\nHARI SREENIVASAN:\nAnd just to give people a little bit of a brief timeline \u2013 Iraqi forces control this area for a while and then in June ISIS took over the area and now it\u2019s kind of back in Kurdish hands?\nLOVEDAY MORRIS:\nRight. So in June 2014 Iraq lost control of a lot of the areas and we have this huge collapse in the face of an ISIS offensive. Over 100,000 soldiers fled and Kurdish forces moved in some of these areas \u2013 some of them maybe took from ISIS and others just moved into into the vacuum. And so Iraqi forces have been in these areas since June 2014. And that\u2019s their main demand that they return to the areas.\nHARI SREENIVASAN:\nWhat\u2019s the likelihood that this standoff right now turns violent? Into some sort of a civil war?\nLOVEDAY MORRIS:\n: I think at this point both sides don\u2019t want violence. Al-Abadi, the prime minister, is really trying to defuse the situation by saying there\u2019s going to be no  military attack. But at the same time there is this buildup of forces so that I think they are trying to, in a way, intimidate the Kurds to withdraw from some areas but they don\u2019t want to see a fight per say. But in this really tense situation there can be a small spark and things can turn violent quite easily.\nHARI SREENIVASAN:\nThank you.\nThe post\nIraqi, Kurdish forces in standoff, weeks after Kurdish vote for independence\nappeared first on\nPBS NewsHour\n.",

        "full_content": "The United Nations says South Sudan\u2019s four-year-old civil war has left half of the nation\u2019s population \u2014 6 million people \u2014 in need of humanitarian aid. The conflict began when South Sudan\u2019s army split between factions loyal to President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar. The two men mobilized their respective tribes, the Dinka and the Nuer. The war has caused what is now one of the world\u2019s worst refugee crises.\nSIMONA FOLTYN\n: Civil war is emptying huge swaths of South Sudan. The violence has uprooted four million people, including two million who\u2019ve fled to neighboring countries. In the last year, more than a million South Sudanese have poured into northern Uganda alone, crossing makeshift bridges like this one to flee fighting, hunger, and brutal attacks on civilians.\nSEME LUPAI, REFUGE\nE: They started fighting very, very severely. So that made us to escape with our properties to this side.\nSIMONA FOLTYN\n: When Seme Lupai\u2019s family went to one of the refugee camps, initially, he stayed behind to look after the family\u2019s most precious commodity \u2014 their cattle. He hid for a year to escape the violence. The refugees carry whatever they can salvage \u2014 mattresses, pots, clothes, notebooks \u2014 remnants of once peaceful lives turned upside down. At checkpoints, Ugandan soldiers search their belongings for weapons, before the refugees proceed to reception centers. After entering Uganda, the refugees sign in at small waystations. For many, it\u2019s the first night spent in safety after walking for days to escape fighting. Levi Arike fled with his wife and four children.\nLEVI ARIKE, REFUGEE\n: When the gunshots started, we laid under a tree with the whole family, because there was nowhere else to hide. We waited for the fighting to stop, and then we got up and started walking to Uganda.\nSIMONA FOLTYN\n: Uganda now shoulders most of the burden of Africa\u2019s biggest refugee crisis, managing a constellation of camps which require food, water, healthcare, and policing. At Imvepi Camp, now home to more than 120,000 South Sudanese, new arrivals receive vaccinations, hot meals, and basic items such as soap and plastic tarps to build a house. The government also gives each refugee family a small plot of land, about a twentieth of an acre, where they can build a tent shelter and grow crops to eat or sell. But the land often proves too rocky for farming.\nSIMONA FOLTYN, IMVEPI REFUGEE CAMP, NORTHERN UGANDA\n: After completing the registration process, the new arrivals will receive their plot, to start a new life as refugees in Uganda. While they are safe here, there are many challenges ahead, not least processing the trauma of what they experienced back home.\nThis woman, who we\u2019ll call \u201cAgnes,\u201d agreed to tell us about her harrowing experience. She says four government soldiers from President Salva Kiir\u2019s Dinka tribe stopped her as she was fleeing South Sudan and raped her right in front of her family.\nAGNES\n(translated to English): When they started raping me, they told me not to raise alarm, otherwise they would shoot me. Still when I\u2019m sleeping, I\u2019m dreaming of the Dinka, that they are coming to rape me again.\nSIMONA FOLTYN\n: How often do you have those dreams?\nAGNES\n: Daily, every time I lie down, those dreams come.\nSIMONA FOLTYN\n: A recent Human Rights Watch report on South Sudan found \u201c\u2026a clear pattern of government forces unlawfully targeting civilians for killings, rapes, torture\u2026and destruction of property..\u201d The victims are from ethnic groups suspected to support the rebels.\nAGNES\n: They are doing it, because they know very well that those soldiers are our brothers. So they do it to punish them..\nSIMONA FOLTYN\n: Although the rebels, known as the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army In Opposition, purport to protect local communities, there are also reports of their fighters assaulting civilians near the Ugandan border. Josephine Yanya told us she didn\u2019t feel safe in the presence of either side\u2019s soldiers. Her family and neighbors fled their village after government soldiers killed her uncle.\nThey hid in the mountains only to find themselves under attack again, this time by opposition fighters from the Nuer tribe loyal to former vice president Riek Machar. Yanya says ethnic Nuer soldiers from the SPLA-IO rebel group raped a member of her group and stole her father\u2019s\u2019 cattle.\nJOSEPHINE YANYA\n(translated to English): Before we were thinking that the rebels would protect us, but if they are lacking food, they just come and take things by force.\nSIMONA FOLTYN\n: With nowhere left to hide, Yanya fled to Uganda with her son.\nBut instead of finding a place to rebuild their lives, they are in limbo. And aid groups don\u2019t have enough food to distribute.\nJOSEPHINE YANYA\n(translated to English):We are getting small food rations. I know it won\u2019t be enough even for one month.\nSIMONA FOLTYN\n: According to the United Nations, the international community has given less than a-third of the $1.4 billion dollars needed for the refugee response in South Sudan\u2019s neighboring countries. These refugees foresee more hardship and have no idea when they might return home.\nJOSEPHINE YANYA\n(translated to English): I\u2019m always praying for peace in South Sudan, and until then, I\u2019ll just stay here.\nThe post\nSouth Sudan civil war causes Africa\u2019s worst refugee crisis\nappeared first on\nPBS NewsHour\n.",

        "full_content": "In August, fellow reporter Jason Patinkin and I crossed on foot from northern Uganda into rebel-held South Sudan. Over the course of four days, we walked more than 40 miles through the bush, escorted by rebel soldiers, to shed light on one of the world\u2019s most underreported conflicts.\nReporting on South Sudan\u2019s war, which began in 2013, has always been a challenge due to the risk and logistical hurdles associated with accessing remote areas where fighting takes place. But over the past year, covering the war and its humanitarian fallout has become particularly difficult. Since the beginning of this year, South Sudan\u2019s government has banned at least 20 foreign journalists in an apparent effort to silence reporters who had a track record of critically reporting on the government.\nThe war has had a devastating impact on South Sudanese communities, but much of it has remained out of the limelight of international media.\nThis systematic crackdown on the foreign press (South Sudanese journalists have long risked imprisonment and death for doing their work) coincided with two important developments. In November 2016, the United Nations warned that the violence being committed against civilians in the southern region of Equatoria risked spiraling into genocide. Then, in February, the UN declared a man-made famine, warning that 100,000 people were at risk of starving to death as a result of civil war.\nJournalists seeking to cover these events were left with two equally unsavory options: self-censorship or a risky trip to rebel-held parts of the country. Only a handful of journalists have attempted the latter since fighting escalated in July last year. For us, this was our second embed with the rebels this year.\nWe set off from a town in northern Uganda at five in the morning, bouncing along a bumpy dirt track towards the South Sudan border. Crammed into our four-wheel drive were rebel commander Martin Abucha, a dual American and South Sudanese citizen who we planned to profile for our PBS NewsHour Weekend segment, a couple of guides, and several duffle bags stuffed with our tents, sleeping bags, emergency medical kits and provisions to last us four days.\nJust as the sun began to rise above a distant range of hills that we aimed to cross later that day, our car came to a halt in front of a stream. Because of the rainy reason, it carried more water than usual. It was time to disembark and start walking, or \u201cfooting,\u201d as South Sudanese tend to call it.\nWe took off our shoes and waded through the stream\u2019s chilly waters. This was the first of a many rivers we\u2019d have to cross along the way, either on foot or in small flimsy canoes dug out from tree trunks. Each time, we dreaded the idea of falling in with our camera gear.\nThe first part of our journey in northern Uganda felt very much like a hike through a national park. Passing beautiful landscapes and idyllic farming villages, one could almost forget we were headed into a war zone \u2014 but we were about to get a reality check.\nWe had just crossed into South Sudan when out of nowhere, two dozen armed men popped out of the tall grass and surrounded us at gunpoint.\n\u201cStop! Who are you and where are you going?\u201d a soldier called out in Juba Arabic from his hideout no more than 20 yards away, pointing his AK47 at us. Another one next to him had a rocket-propelled grenade propped on his shoulder, also unequivocally aiming it in our direction.\nInstinctively, we threw our hands in the air and exchanged a baffled glance. Had we accidentally bumped into government soldiers? Or perhaps we had come onto the \u201cwrong\u201d rebels? Abucha\u2019s group, called the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army In Opposition, is the biggest but not the only armed group in Equatoria, an area rife with rival militia and bandits who exploit the security vacuum left by war.\nTo our relief, and only after Abucha answered a series of questions, this routine security check quickly gave way to a warm welcome. The platoon would be our escort for the next four days as we trekked to their base and to Loa, Abucha\u2019s hometown.\nKeeping up with the rebels was no easy task. Given the country\u2019s pervasive lack of basic infrastructure, South Sudanese grow up walking for dozens of miles just to go about their daily lives. For sedentary Westerners, keeping the target pace of \u201ctwo meters per second\u201d (around five miles an hour) proved challenging amid 90-degree temperatures, all while filming and plowing our way through dense, itchy elephant grass.\nThe upside of the cumbersome terrain was that it kept us safe. During our four-day trip, we didn\u2019t cross a single road, instead walking along a dizzying network of narrow bush paths the rebels seemed to know like the backs of their hands. An unwanted encounter with government troops, who tended to stick to roads and move around in vehicles as opposed to on foot, was highly unlikely.\nThe closest we got to government-controlled area was a visit to Loa, located just two kilometers away from a main road frequently patrolled by government soldiers. We couldn\u2019t stay long, but the hour we spent on the ground offered us a glimpse into what villages must look like in many parts of Equatoria: burned mud huts, looted schools and clinics, fallow fields and \u2013 most strikingly \u2013 no civilians.\nThe war has had a devastating impact on South Sudanese communities like the one in Loa, but much of it has remained out of the limelight of international media. Our four-day venture into rebel-held South Sudan offered us a rare opportunity to report ground truths, and we are thankful for that.\nThe post\nColumn: Why reporting from South Sudan is so difficult \u2014 and critically needed\nappeared first on\nPBS NewsHour\n.",

        "full_content": "Starbucks, Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover: Remembering Ratan Tata's global ambitions\nGetty Images\nRatan Tata, seen here in 2016, transformed one of India's oldest business houses into a global powerhouse\nRatan Tata, the philanthropist and former chairman of Tata Group who has died aged 86, played an instrumental role in globalising and modernising one of India\u2019s oldest business houses.\nHis ability to take bold, audacious business risks informed a high-profile acquisition strategy that kept the salt-to-steel conglomerate founded 155 years ago by his forefathers relevant after India liberalised its economy in the 1990s.\nAt the turn of the millennium, Tata executed the biggest cross-border acquisition in Indian corporate history - buying Tetley Tea, the world\u2019s second largest producer of teabags. The iconic British brand was three times the size of the small Tata group company that had bought it.\nIn subsequent years, his ambitions grew only bigger, as his group swallowed up major British industrial giants like the steelmaker Corus and the luxury car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover.\nWhile the acquisitions didn\u2019t always pay off - Corus was bought at very expensive valuations just before the global financial crisis of 2007, and remained a drag on Tata Steel\u2019s performance for years - they were big power moves.\nThey also had a great symbolic effect, says Mircea Raianu, historian and author of Tata: The Global Corporation That Built Indian Capitalism. He adds that they \u201crepresented 'the empire striking back' as a business from a former colony took over the motherland's prize assets, reversing the sneering attitude with which British industrialists looked upon the Tata Group a century earlier\u201d.\nObituary: Ratan Tata, the 'modest' Indian tycoon\nIndia's Ratan Tata: in his own words\nGetty Images\nTata operates across 100 countries, including owning the UK\u2019s largest steelworks at Port Talbot\nGlobal ambitions\nThe Tata Group\u2019s outlook had been \u201coutward-oriented\u201d from the very beginning, according to Andrea Goldstein, an economist who published a study in 2008 on the internationalisation of Indian companies, with a particular focus on Tata.\nAs early as in the 1950s, Tata companies operated with foreign partners.\nBut Ratan Tata was keen to \u201cinternationalise in giant strides, not in token, incremental steps\u201d, Ms Goldstein pointed out.\nHis unconventional education in architecture and a ring side view of his family group companies may have played a part in the way he thought about expansion, says Mr Raianu. But it was the \u201cstructural transformation of the group\u201d he steered, that allowed him to execute his vision for a global footprint.\nTata had to fight an exceptional corporate battle at Bombay House, the group headquarters, when he took over as the chairman of Tata Sons in 1991 - an appointment that coincided with India\u2019s decision to open up its economy.\nHe began centralising increasingly decentralised, domestic-focused operations by showing the door to a string of 'satraps' (a Persian term meaning an imperial governor) at Tata Steel, Tata Motors and the Taj Group of Hotels who ran operations with little corporate oversight from the holding company.\nDoing this allowed him not only to surround himself with people who could help him execute his global vision, but also prevent the Tata Group - protected thus far from foreign competition - from fading into irrelevance as India opened up.\nAt both Tata Sons, the holding company, as well as individual groups within it, he appointed  foreigners, non-resident Indians and executives with contacts and networks across the world in the management team.\nHe also set up the Group Corporate Centre (GCC) to provide strategic direction to group companies. It provided \u201cM&A [mergers and acquisitions] advisory support, helped the group companies to mobilise capital and assessed whether the target company would fit into the Tata's values\u201d, researchers at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore wrote in a 2016 paper.\nThe GCC also helped Tata Motors raise money for high-profile buyouts like Jaguar Land Rover which dramatically changed the global perception of a company that was essentially a tractor manufacturer.\n\u201cThe JLR takeover was widely seen as 'revenge' on Ford, which had derisively refused to acquire Tata Motors in the early 90s and then was beaten to the punch on the deal by Tata Motors. Taken together, these acquisitions suggested that Indian corporates had 'arrived' on the global stage just as growth rates were picking up and the liberalising reforms bearing fruit,\u201d says Mr Raianu.\nToday, the $128bn group operates across 100 countries with a substantial portion of its total revenues coming from outside India.\nGetty Images\nThe Tata Nano, billed as the world's cheapest car, was a flop\nThe misses\nWhile the Tata Group made significant strides overseas in the early 2000s, domestically the failure of the\nTata Nano\n\u2013 launched and marketed as the world\u2019s cheapest car \u2013 was a setback for Tata.\nThis was his most ambitious project, but he had clearly misread India\u2019s consumer market this time.\nBrand experts say an aspirational India didn\u2019t want to associate with the cheap car tag. And Tata himself eventually admitted that the \"poor man's car\" tag was a \"stigma\" that needed to be undone.\nHe believed there could be a resurrection of his product, but the Tata Nano was eventually discontinued after sales plummeted year on year.\nSuccession at the Tata Group also became a thorny issue.\nMr Tata remained far too involved in running the conglomerate after his retirement in 2012, through the \"backdoor\" of the Tata Trust which owns two-thirds of the stock holding of Tata Sons, the holding company, say experts.\n\u201cWithout assigning Ratan Tata blame for it, his involvement in the succession dispute with [Cyrus] Mistry undoubtedly tarnished the image of the group,\u201d says Mr Rainu.\nMistry, who died in a car crash in 2022 was ousted as Tata chairman in 2016 following a boardroom coup that sparked a long-running legal battle which the Tatas eventually won.\nGetty Images\nTata's acquisition of Jaguar and other foreign brands was seen as evidence Indian firms had arrived on the global stage\nA lasting legacy\nIn spite of the many wrong turns,  Tata retired in 2012, leaving the vast empire he inherited in a much stronger position both domestically and globally.\nAlong with big-ticket acquisitions, his bid to modernise the group with a sharp focus on IT has served the group well over the years.\nWhen many of his big bets went sour, one high-performing firm, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), along with JLR carried the \u201cdead weight of other ailing companies\u201d, Mr Raianu says.\nTCS is today India\u2019s largest IT services company and the cash cow of the Tata Group, contributing to three-quarters of its revenue.\nIn 2022, the Tata Group also brought back India\u2019s flagship carrier Air India into its fold approximately 69 years after the government took control of the airline. This was a dream come true for Ratan Tata, a trained pilot himself, but also a bold bet given how capital intensive it is to run an airline.\nBut the Tatas seem to be in a stronger position than ever before to take big bold bets on everything from airlines to semiconductor manufacturing.\nIndia under Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears to have clearly adopted an industrial policy of creating \"national champions\" whereby a few large conglomerates are built up and promoted in order to achieve rapid economic outcomes that extend across priority sectors.\nAlong with newer industrial groups like Adani, the decks are clearly stacked in favour of the Tata Group to benefit from this.\nAsia\nIndia",

        "full_content": "Obituary: Ratan Tata, the 'modest' Indian tycoon\nGetty Images\nTata led a \"salt-to-software\" conglomerate of more than 100 companies\nRatan Tata, who has died aged 86, was one of India's most internationally recognised business leaders.\nThe tycoon led the Tata Group - known as a \"salt-to-software\" conglomerate of more than 100 companies, employing some 660,000 people - for more than two decades. Its annual revenues are in excess of $100bn (\u00a376.5bn).\nFounded by Jamsetji Tata, a pioneer of Indian business, the 155-year-old Tata Group straddles a business empire ranging from Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel to aviation and salt pans.\nThe ethos of the company \"yokes capitalism to philanthropy, by doing business in ways that make the lives of others better\", according to Peter Casey, author of The Story of Tata, an authorised book on the group.\nFollow our live coverage here\nTata Sons, the holding company of the group, has a \"number of companies that includes privately held and publicly traded companies, yet they are in essence all owned by a philanthropic trust\", he explains.\nRatan Tata was born in 1937 in a traditional family of Parsis - a highly educated and prosperous community that traces its ancestry to Zoroastrian refugees in India. His parents separated in the 1940s.\nGetty Images\nJRD Tata (centre) asked Ratan Tata (left) to join the firm after the latter's return to India from the US\nTata went to college in the US, where he got a degree in architecture at Cornell University. During his seven-year-long stay, he learned to drive cars and fly. He had some harrowing experiences: he once lost an engine while flying a helicopter in college and twice lost the single engine in his plane. \"So I had to glide in,\" he told an interviewer. Later, he would often fly his company's business jet.\nHe returned to India in 1962 when his grandmother Lady Navajbai fell ill and called for him. It was then that JRD Tata - a relative from a different branch of the family - asked him to join the Tata Group. \"He [JRD Tata] was\nmy greatest mentor\n... he was like a father and a brother to me - and not enough has been said about that,\" Tata told an interviewer.\nIndia's Ratan Tata: In his own words\nRatan Tata was sent to a company steel plant in Jamshedpur in eastern India where he spent a couple of years on the factory floor before becoming the technical assistant to the manager. In the early 70s, he took over two ailing group firms, one making radios and TVs and the other textiles. He managed to turn around the first, and had mixed results with the textile company.\nIn 1991, JRD Tata, who had led the group for over half a century, appointed Ratan Tata as his successor over senior company aspirants for that position. \"If you were to find the publications of that time, the criticism was personal - JRD got clubbed with nepotism and I was branded as the wrong choice,\" Ratan Tata later said.\nPeter Casey writes that under Ratan Tata's leadership, a \"great but rather stodgy Indian manufacturer began emerging as a global brand with great emphasis on consumer goods\".\nGetty Images\nRatan Tata during the inauguration of the Nano car in 2008\nBut the journey was a mixed one.\nDuring his tenure the group made many bold acquisitions, among them\nthe takeover of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus\nand\nUK-based car brands Jaguar and Land Rover\n. Some of those decisions paid off, while others - including a failed telecom venture - have cost the company a lot of money.\nA high point came in 2000, when Tata bought Tetley and became the world's second-largest tea company. The deal was the largest takeover of an international brand by an Indian company.\nA few years later, a visiting journalist from a UK-based newspaper asked Tata whether he liked the irony of an Indian company buying a leading British brand. \"Tata is too shrewd and too shy to be caught gloating about his successes like some territory-grabbing East India Company nabob,\" the journalist later wrote.\nTata's foray into building a safe, affordable car turned out to be a disappointment. It was launched amid great fanfare in 2009 as a compact with the base model costing just 100,000 rupees ($1,222; \u00a3982). But after the initial success and euphoria, the brand began to lose out to other manufacturers due to issues with production and marketing.\nTata later said it was a \"huge mistake to brand Nano as the world's cheapest car. People don't want to be seen driving the world's cheapest car!\"\nGetty images\nRatan Tata was a licensed pilot who often flew his company business jet\nHis resilience was also tested during the\nMumbai terror attacks\nof 26 November, 2008. Tata's marquee Taj Mahal Palace was one of the two luxury hotels that was attacked, along with a train station, a hospital, a Jewish cultural centre, and some other targets in Mumbai.\nThirty-three of the 166 people who died in the 60-hour siege were at the Taj. This included 11 hotel employees, a third of the hotel's total casualties. Tata pledged to look after the families of employees who were killed or injured, and paid the relatives of those killed the salaries they would have earned for the rest of their lives. He also spent more than $1bn to restore the damaged hotel within 21 months.\nTowards the end of his career, Tata found himself embroiled in an unsavoury controversy. In October 2016 he returned to Tata Sons as interim chairman for a few months after the previous incumbent,\nCyrus Mistry, was ousted\n, sparking a bitter management feud (Mistry died in a car crash in September 2022). The role was eventually given to Natarajan Chandrasekaran, who was formerly the chief executive of Tata Consultancy Services, India's most valuable company with a market capitalisation of $67bn.\nPeter Casey described Tata as a \"modest, reserved and even shy man\". He found a \"stately calm\" about him and a \"fierce discipline\", which included preparing a handwritten to-do list every day. He also described himself as a \"bit of an optimist\".\nTata was also a modest and reflective businessman. After the police were called in to end a strike that crippled operations at one of his firm's factories in Pune in 1989, Tata told journalists: \"Perhaps we took our workers for granted. We assumed that we were doing all that we could do for them, when probably we were not.\"\nIn 2009, Tata spoke at a school alumni function about his dream for his country, \"where every Indian has an equal opportunity to shine on merit\".\n\"In a country like ours,\" he said, \"you have to try and lead by example, not flaunt your wealth and prominence.\"\nEntrepreneurship\nIndia\nTata Group",

        "full_content": "Art becomes outrage: Kolkata festival confronts crime against female doctor\nSwastik Pal\nOne puja chose Lajja or shame as its theme to focus on the alleged rape and murder of the doctor\nOn 9 August, the Indian city of Kolkata was shaken when a trainee doctor was found raped and murdered at one of its oldest hospitals. Though an arrest was swiftly made, accusations of a cover-up and evidence-tampering quickly surfaced, fuelling public outrage. Since then, daily protests, human chains and candlelight vigils have filled Kolkata\u2019s streets. Now, the city\u2019s largest festival unfolds amid some of the city\u2019s most fervent protests in years.\nKolkata is celebrating its biggest annual festival - Durga Puja, when the ten-armed Goddess Durga is said to visit her earthly home, her entire family in tow.\nAt Durga Puja pandals - or temporary temples - the goddess stands in the middle astride a lion, flanked by her children - elephant-headed Ganesha, warrior god Kartikeya on his peacock, the goddesses Lakshmi and Saraswati - while the defeated buffalo demon lies at her feet, symbolising the triumph of good over evil.\nThese days, it\u2019s not just the gods that draw the crowds. The pandals have become quite elaborate. Some recreate landmarks like Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa or the mangrove forests of Sundarbans. Others are installations with social messaging - conserve water,  pray for world peace, save handicrafts.\nThat led to Durga Puja being billed as one of the biggest street art festivals in the world. Arts organisation Mass Art has been putting together previews of selected Pujas, especially so that foreign guests can get a sense, says its secretary, Dhrubajyoti Bose Suvo, of how a \u201ccity transforms into a public gallery\u201d.\nBut this year, the largest street art event of the city has come face to face with the biggest street protests Kolkata has seen in years. Some of the idols are different, and even the artwork on the walls reflects anguish and protest with figures of women and animals rendered in stark red, black and white.\nSwastik Pal\nAn unusual representation of a Durga without a body by artist Sushanta Pal at Tala Prattoy puja...\nSwastik Pal\n...where the goddess's life force is represented by flickering candles\nThe protests broke out\nafter the 31-year-old doctor was found brutally killed at RG Kar Medical College on the night of 9 August. After a gruelling 36-hour shift, she had fallen asleep in a seminar room due to the lack of a designated rest area. Her half-naked body, bearing severe injuries, was discovered the next morning on the podium.\n\u201cOf course there is an effect [of the incident] on us,\u201d says visual artist Sanatan Dinda. \u201cI do not paint inside an ivory tower. I speak of the society around me in my work.\u201d\nUpset over the incident, Dinda resigned from a government-run arts organisation.  He says, \u201cNow I am on the streets with everyone else. Now I have no fear.\u201d\nIn September, Dinda and the clay artists who built the Durga images in the historic artisan neighbourhood of Kumartuli led a protest march demanding justice for the woman they called \u201cour Durga\u201d.\nDinda says he has made \u201cimprovisations\u201d to the Durga images he was working on this year.\nAt one in Bagha Jatin in south Kolkata, his mother Goddess looks more fierce than maternal. The lion she normally rides is springing out of her chest. Each of her ten arms holds a spear to slay evil. The artwork on the walls reflects anguish and protest with figures of naked women and animals rendered in stark red, black and white.\nSwastik Pal\nA wall graffiti by artist Santana Dinda at a Puja pandal\nSwastik Pal\nA tableau recreates the bereaved family of the doctor depicted in the portrait on the wall at a Puja\nArt as protest is not new.\nJean-Michel Basquiat\u2019s\nDefacement\n, commemorating the 1983 police killing of a man allegedly writing graffiti in the New York subway, found renewed relevance during the Black Lives Matter movement. Public artists like Jenny Holzer, Keith Haring, Diego Rivera, and Banksy - whose stencils span walls from Kyiv to the West Bank - have long used art to deliver political messages.\nDurga Puja art is public art, but it's also central to a religious festival that fuels the state's economy. A British Council report valued Durga Puja\u2019s 2019 economic impact at over $4.5bn, nearly 3% of West Bengal state\u2019s GDP.\nWith so much at stake, neighbourhood clubs organising pujas have to tread warily. They cannot alienate thousands of ordinary citizens looking for a good time, not a sermon. They get financial grants from the government that\u2019s facing the protests. They have to work with the police on permits and traffic control.\nSwastik Pal\nThe idol stands before the Constitution, with windows illustrating scenes that spark dialogue on social issues\nSwastik Pal\nActors perform street theatre to teach viewers about the gap between rights and realities\nA few have opted to forego taking money from the government.\nOne puja in Kankurgachi, in the northeastern side of the city, chose Lajja (Shame) as its theme after the protests erupted. Its Durga is covering her eyes, her lion keeping vigil over the body of a woman wrapped in a white sheet. The organiser is openly affiliated with the state\u2019s opposition party.\nClose by, another puja creates a tableau of the bereaved family, the mother sitting on the bed, the father at a sewing machine, their daughter\u2019s picture in doctor\u2019s scrubs on the wall. Other organisers are more circumspect, not wanting to wade into political waters.\n\u201cBut we still want to make a point, especially as a women-led women-run club,\u201d says Mousumi Dutta, president of the Arjunpur Amra Sabai Club.\nTheir theme this year is Discrimination. The artist uses the Constitution of India and its articles promising equality as the backdrop to the goddess while local actors enact the gap between the promise of the Constitution and reality through street theatre.\nThe theme had been decided earlier but the tragedy gave it a different urgency. \u201cWe have decided to not call this year\u2019s Durga Puja a festival,\u201d says Dutta. \u201cWe are calling it a pledge instead. A pledge to create a world where we won\u2019t have to keep coming out on to the streets to demand justice.\u201d\nSwastik Pal\nAt Bagha Jatin puja in south Kolkata, the Goddess looks more fierce than maternal\nSwastik Pal\nArtist Sanatan Dinda integrates the name used by many media outlets for the victim, Tilottama, into his signature\nThe demand for justice for a woman resonates with Durga Puja anyway, a festival built around a goddess vanquishing evil. One puja had already chosen women power as its theme which now matches the zeitgeist.\nDurga puja theme designers say they were already neck-deep in work when the protests erupted.\n\u201cPerhaps if it had happened earlier it would have been different. By August I was committed to the organisers and to some 450 people working with me,\u201d says Susanta Shibani Pal. But he says the issue \u201csubconsciously\u201d crept into the art.\nHis installation Biheen (The Void) for the Tala Prattoy puja, covers 35,000 sq ft, immersing the viewer into what he calls a \u201cblack hole\u201d.\nHis Durga has no body, her life force represented by a flickering candle, much like the candles that are part of the protests. \u201cA viewer might read this as my protest. I might call it coincidence. I started this work before RG Kar happened,\" he said.\nWhile some are bringing the mood of protest into their Durga Puja art, others are bringing protest art to their Durga Puja. Chandreyee Chatterjee\u2019s family has been celebrating Durga Puja at their home in Kolkata for 16 years. Chatterjee also participated in many of the street protests.\nSwastik Pal\nMillions flock to see the pandals during Pujas in Kolkata\nShe admits she was in no mood to celebrate this year. They will still have a Durga Puja but with a difference. \u201cWe will do what the rituals require, nothing more. Anything that comes under the heading of celebration, like dancing, is being done away with this year.\u201d\nShe and her friends have also had an artistic little badge made. It shows a hand grasping a flaming torch. Underneath in Bengali are the words \u201cWe want justice.\u201d\n\u201cI will be giving it to friends and family who come to our Puja,\u201d says Chatterjee. \u201cWe want to remind people we have a long long way to go.\u201d\nRape in India\nAsia\nKolkata\nIndia",

The dog was rescued from the streets of Goa state, which gave it its name.\nThe tycoon, who had a reputation for being modest and shy, was known for his philanthropic work, including animal welfare, health and education.\nReuters\nTata had been fond of Goa, a rescue dog that lived with him him in Mumbai\nTata's death was announced on Wednesday night. He had been admitted to hospital earlier in the week.\n\"His legacy will continue to inspire us as we strive to uphold the principles he so passionately championed,\" a company statement said.\nThe Tata Group is one of India's largest companies, with annual revenues in excess of $100bn (\u00a376.5bn), and he was one of India's most internationally-recognised business leaders.\nFounded 155 years ago, the group straddles a business empire ranging from Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel, to aviation and salt pans.\nDuring his 20-year tenure, the conglomerate made several high-profile acquisitions, including the takeover of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus, UK-based car brands Jaguar and Land Rover, and Tetley, the world's second-largest tea company.\nSome of those decisions paid off, while others - including a failed telecom venture and the Nano, which was billed as the world's cheapest car but flopped - lost money.\nStarbucks, Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover: Remembering Ratan Tata's global ambitions\nObituary: Ratan Tata, the 'modest' Indian tycoon\nIndia's Ratan Tata: in his own words\nTata was born in a traditional Parsi family in 1937. He studied architecture and structural engineering at Cornell University in the US.\nIn 1962, he joined Tata Industries - the promoter company of the group - as an assistant and spent six months training at a company plant in Jamshedpur.\nFrom there, he went on to work at the Tata Iron and Steel Company (now Tata Steel), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and National Radio and Electronics (Nelco).\nIn 1991, JRD Tata, who had led the group for over half a century, appointed Ratan Tata as his successor. \"He [JRD Tata] was my greatest mentor... he was like a father and a brother to me - and not enough has been said about that,\" Tata later told an interviewer.\nIn 2008, the Indian government awarded him the Padma Vibhushan, the country's second-highest civilian honour.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed Tata as a \"visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being\".\nAsia\nIndia\nTata Group",

As the actor turns 70 on Thursday, film writer Yasser Usman explores her charm and legacy.\nRekha is one of India\u2019s most glamorous icons - a woman who captured headlines and people's imaginations for decades while blazing a path for generations of female actors in India.\nIn the 1970s, she was widely covered for her transformation from a loud, gauche young girl from southern India who entered Bollywood with no knowledge of the Hindi language to a discerning National Award-winning actor who spoke impeccable Urdu and Hindi and brimmed with confidence.\nBut the unrelenting attention on her personal life took a toll as she withdrew from public life in the years since, choosing to fiercely protect her privacy.\nYet, time and again over the past few decades, Rekha has proved that the air of enigma surrounding her has only left audiences wanting more.\nWith almost every public appearance, she still captures hearts and creates viral moments on the internet.\nBorn in Chennai (then Madras) in 1954 as Bhanurekha, she was deeply affected by her mother's - actress Pushpavalli - struggles and hurt by the absence of her father, Tamil film star Gemini Ganesan.\nShe was still a teenager when she started acting, mainly because her family faced financial difficulties. In Bombay (now Mumbai), the home of Hindi cinema, she had to grapple with an unfamiliar language and a male-dominated industry.\n\u201cBombay was like a jungle, and I had walked in unarmed. It was one of the most frightening phases of my life\u2026 Guys did try and take advantage of my vulnerability,\u201d she once said.\nGetty Images\nBollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan greets Rekha at an award ceremony\nAs her early work garnered attention, she faced relentless body-shaming, with viewers, journalists and even other actors ridiculing her weight and skin colour.\nIn her later interviews, she also spoke about how, as a teenager, she was forced to do some scenes she wasn't comfortable.\nJust as everything seemed to stack up against her, the young actor flipped the script.\nWith candid interviews and statements unheard of in 1970s India, Rekha became a headliner act for gossip magazines. The young starlet\u2019s unapologetic frankness about her sexuality was nothing short of revolutionary.\nRekha was unflinchingly open about her relationships with her co-actors. But due to a lack of reciprocation in public by the men in question, she was often humiliated, with the press using unsavoury headlines to describe her.\nIn part challenged by the narrative around her, Rekha underwent a dramatic makeover in the mid-70s when she started fitness trends and learnt to pick the right make-up that worked for her.\nGetty Images\nRekha is known as a style diva who constantly keeps reinventing herself\nAn early pioneer of fitness trends, she brought liquid diets into popular conversations, became an ambassador for aerobics and embraced yoga long before it became a celebrity craze.\nOnce derided for her unconventional appearance, Rekha managed to redefine beauty and fitness standards and create a more democratic industry for actors of all skin tones.\nBut it was the re-invention of her craft that truly made her an ambassador of transformations.\nAlong with her appearance, she also honed her acting with meticulous attention to diction and technique.\nHer performances were marked by a rare emotional depth in critically acclaimed films like Ghar (1978), where she delicately portrayed the trauma of a rape survivor. She effortlessly transitioned to comedy in Khoobsurat (1980) and her alluring performance in Silsila (1981) cemented her iconic mainstream appeal.\nThat same year, her career-defining role in Umrao Jaan elevated her to the ranks of India\u2019s most celebrated actresses and earned her a national award.\nGetty Images\nRekha (centre) performs during the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) Awards in Bangkok in 2018\nHer foray into arthouse cinema showcased her immense versatility, with exquisite performances in Kalyug (1981), Utsav (1984) and Ijaazat (1987). Her versatility was on full display in the action-packed intensity of the blockbuster Khoon Bhari Maang (1988).\nHer ability to seamlessly transition between genres and characters was the hallmark of her career.\nRekha heralded a new era in the Hindi film industry where she owned her narrative, built an aura around herself, and was rightfully crowned a diva.\nIn 1990, she married businessman Mukesh Aggarwal but the couple soon grew apart. The same year, when she was in the US for a programme, her estranged husband of just a few months tragically took his own life.\nShe returned home to lurid media headlines such as \u201cThe Macabre Truth Behind Mukesh\u2019s Suicide\u201d and \u201cThe Black Widow\u201d.\nGetty Images\nThe actor's life has always been the subject of intense public scrutiny\nPosters of her film Sheshnaag (1990) were vandalised, and she was shunned for a while by the film industry.\nBeing cast out overnight set off her final transformative phase.\nFor about a year, she put all her energy into the action-packed revenge-drama Phool Baney Angaare (1991), which did well at the box office.\nBut despite the audience\u2019s love and her successful comeback, Rekha, once known for her fierce and candid persona, now presented a significantly toned-down, melancholic, and philosophical approach.\nIn an interview to BBC,\nshe once said\n\u201c[The media] would write whatever they want adding their own spicy takes\u2026 I was very angry and hurt. And whenever I am very hurt I tend to shut up. So that\u2019s exactly what I did \u2013 I stopped talking.\u201d\nThis was perhaps her final makeover, a metamorphosis which firmly established her as the enigmatic diva we know today.\nSince then, not much is known of her personal life and her film appearances have grown sparser.\nYet, when she leans into her diva image, like in the sensuous song Kaisi Paheli Zindagani from Parineeta (2005), or when she takes to the stage to dance to one of her old hits, her fans are still glad to celebrate.\nFilm\nBollywood\nIndia",

But the court has given us a very precious gift. We would now be able to get our son back,\u201d the mother, Harbir Kaur, told the BBC.\nMs Kaur and her husband Gurvinder Singh petitioned the court after Delhi\u2019s Ganga Ram Hospital in December 2020 refused to release their son\u2019s semen which was stored in their fertility lab.\nThe couple\u2019s 30-year-old son, Preet Inder Singh, had been diagnosed in June 2020 with Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma - a form of blood cancer - and admitted to the hospital for treatment.\n\u201cBefore he began chemotherapy, the hospital advised him to store his semen as the treatment could adversely affect the quality of his sperm,\u201d Gurvinder Singh told the BBC.\nPreet Inder, who was unmarried, agreed and his sample was frozen on 27 June 2020. He died in early September.\nA few months later, when the grief-stricken parents sought access to their son\u2019s frozen sperm, the hospital declined their request. The couple then petitioned the Delhi High Court.\nGetty Images\nThere is no international consensus on the issue of posthumous reproduction\nThe couple, who are in their 60s, told the court that they would bring up any child born using their son\u2019s semen sample. And in the event of their death, their two daughters have given an undertaking in court that they will take full responsibility for the child.\nIn her order last week, Justice Prathiba Singh said that \u201cunder Indian law, there was no prohibition against posthumous reproduction\u201d if the sperm owner had given consent.\nShe added that parents were entitled to the sample as in the absence of a spouse or children, they became legal heirs under the Hindu Succession Act.\nThe couple say they approached the court because they wanted to carry on his \"legacy\" and that the order would help them preserve a connection with him and help their family name to continue.\n\u201cHe loved his sisters and was much loved by his friends. He is the screensaver on my phone. I start my day by looking at his face every morning,\u201d Ms Kaur said. She did not want to share a photo of him with the BBC over privacy concerns.\nShe added that the family was considering using his sperm in surrogacy and that a relative had agreed to be the surrogate. \u201cWe will keep it in the family,\u201d she said. Under Indian law commercial surrogacy is illegal.\nThe case is rare, but not without precedent, her lawyer Suruchii Aggarwal told the BBC.\nGetty Images\nThe court has cited a number of cases of posthumous reproduction in its order\nIn court, she cited\nthe 2018 case\nof a 48-year-old woman in the western Indian city of Pune who got twin grandchildren through surrogacy using the semen of her 27-year-old son who had died of brain cancer in Germany.\nHer son, who was also unmarried, had authorised his mother and sister to use his semen after his death and the hospital in Germany handed over his sample to them.\nMs Aggarwal also\ngave the example\nof a case from 2019 where the New York Supreme Court allowed the parents of a 21-year-old military cadet killed in a skiing accident to use his frozen sperm to have a grandchild.\nIn her order, Justice Singh also cited a number of cases of posthumous reproduction, including a 2002 case from Israel where the parents of a 19-year-old soldier killed in Gaza had obtained legal permission to use their son\u2019s sperm to have a child through a surrogate mother.\nI never met my daughter's dad - she was his dying wish\nThe Israelis who want grandchildren from their dead sons\u2019 sperm\nSo if there is a precedent, why did the hospital reject the couple's request?\nAs Justice Singh noted in her order, there is no international consensus on the issue.\nThe US, UK, Japan, Czech Republic and some other countries allow posthumous reproduction with written consent. Australia imposes an additional condition of a one-year wait period after the death to allow time for emotions to settle.\nThe practice is prohibited in a number of countries such as Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, France, Malaysia, Pakistan, Hungary and Slovenia, while most of India\u2019s South Asian neighbours - Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh - have no guidelines.\nAnd even in countries that have laws on posthumous reproduction, a majority of cases involve a spouse who wants to use frozen eggs or sperm to conceive.\nThe number of bereaved parents seeking sperm of their sons has risen in\nIsrael\n, and as the conflict with Russia has escalated, soldiers in Ukraine are offered semen cryopreservation free of charge. But in India, this is still relatively rare.\nGetty Images\nFertility clinics in Ukraine have offered free semen cryopreservation to soldiers\nIn court, Ganga Ram Hospital said legally they could only release the sample to the spouse. They said there were no clear laws or guidelines that governed the release of semen samples of an unmarried deceased male to his parents or legal heirs.\nThe Indian government also opposed the couple\u2019s petition, saying that surrogacy laws in India were meant to assist infertile couples or women, not people who wanted to have a grandchild.\nThe authorities also pointed out that Preet Inder was unmarried - India\u2019s\nAssisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Act 2021\nbars single people from having children via surrogacy - and that he had not left any written or oral consent for the use of his frozen sperm so his parents did not have an automatic right to use it.\nMs Aggarwal, the couple\u2019s lawyer, argued in court that while filling in the form for storing his semen, Preet Inder had clearly specified that it was for the purpose of IVF.\nThe form, she told the BBC, had the mobile numbers of both father and son, which implied consent. She pointed out that the father had been paying the lab for preserving the sample.\nThe ART Act, she said, was introduced to stop commercial use of surrogacy, to regulate and supervise clinics, not to impinge upon personal freedoms of aggrieved parents.\nJustice Singh agreed with Ms Aggarwal\u2019s argument that Preet Inder had given consent for his sperm to be used for the purpose of having children.\n\u201cHe was not married and did not have any partner. He intended for the sample to be used in order to bear a child. When he passed away, the parents being the heirs of the deceased, and semen samples being genetic material and constituting property, the parents are entitled for release of the same.\u201d\nUnder those circumstances, the court said they could not prohibit the couple from accessing the semen sample of their son.\nThe court order, Ms Kaur says, has offered her a \u201cglimmer of hope, a light\u201d that \u201cwe will be able to bring our son back\u201d.\n\u201cI have prayed every day to fulfil all my child\u2019s unfulfilled desires. It\u2019s taken four years, but my prayers have been answered,\u201d she adds.\nHealth\nIndia\nNew Delhi\nSurrogacy",

        "full_content": "Kashmir and Haryana prove India exit polls wrong\nEFE\nSupporters of the National Conference celebrate as the party leads in Jammu and Kashmir\nThe northern Indian state of Haryana and Indian-administered Kashmir sprang surprises on Tuesday as votes were counted in assembly elections there.\nMost exit polls had predicted a hung assembly in Kashmir but an alliance of the main opposition Congress and the National Conference Party (NC) are on course for a landslide in the 90-member house and poised to form a government.\nIn Haryana, which also has 90 seats, predictions of a Congress landslide were upended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which has proved the pollsters wrong.\nThe BJP-led government appears on course to return for a rare third consecutive term in Haryana.\nThe polls in Kashmir are significant as these are first assembly elections there in a decade \u2013 and also the first since the federal government revoked the region's autonomy and changed the former state into a federally- governed territory in 2019.\nUnlike Kashmir - which India and its neighbour Pakistan have fought wars over \u2013 Haryana does not often command global headlines.\nBut the tiny state grabs much attention in India as it is next to the capital, Delhi. Along with Punjab, it is called the bread basket of India for its large wheat and paddy farms, and the city of Gurugram  is home to offices of some of the biggest global brands such as Google, Dell and Samsung.\nThe results are being watched keenly in India as these are the first state assembly polls since the summer parliamentary election. Analysts say Tuesday\u2019s results will set the tone as the country heads into more regional elections, including in the state of Maharashtra and Delhi, over the next few months.\nPTI\nModi's BJP is set to return for a third term in power in Haryana\nSo what happened in Haryana?\nPerhaps the best description of what transpired in the state has come from political scientist Sandeep Shastri.\n\u201cThe Congress has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,\u201d he told the BBC.\nFor weeks, political circles had been abuzz that the BJP was facing a huge wave of anti-incumbency and analysts were confidently saying that the party\u2019s government was on its way out.\nAfter most of the post-election exit polls predicted a Congress landslide, many said it was an election for the party to lose.\nShastri blames the Congress defeat on overconfidence and infighting within the party.\n\u201cThey were confident they would win and became complacent. BJP, on the other hand, worked on issues quietly on the ground and successfully fought anti-incumbency to return to power.\u201d\nBoth parties, he said, tried to form social coalitions by bringing together different caste groups \u2013 the results show the majority chose to support the BJP.\nShastri says differences between two top Congress leaders - Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Kumari Selja, who were contenders for the chief minister\u2019s post - did not go down well with the voters.\nTuesday\u2019s count, however, has been mired in controversy with the Congress accusing the Election Commission (EC) of delaying updating numbers on their website.\nAfter party leader Jairam Ramesh submitted a complaint letter to the Election Commission, Selja said her party may still come out on top.\n\u201cI am telling you\u2026 there is something going on. If all goes well, Congress will form the government in Haryana,\u201d she said.\nBut with numbers not on their side, that will likely remain a dream.\nThe EC has denied the allegations.\nReuters\nAnalysts say the results will set the tone as the country heads into more regional elections\nNo-one thought Kashmir was going to be BJP\u2019s\nIn the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley, the Hindu nationalist BJP has little support, but it enjoys tremendous goodwill in the Hindu-dominated Jammu region. And the results reflect that divide. But the Congress-NC alliance has enough seats and is headed to form a government in the state.\nThe Modi government\u2019s 2019 decision to scrap Article 370 of the constitution, which granted special status to Kashmir, and carve the state into two sent shockwaves around the valley, which elects 47 assembly seats.\nAt his campaign rallies, Modi had promised to restore the region's \u201cstatehood\u201d. But as the results show, that failed to placate angry voters.\nThe region saw a surprisingly high turnout \u2013 but as political analyst Sheikh Showkat Hussain says, they were voting against the BJP and the revocation of the region\u2019s special status.\nArticle 370: What happened with Kashmir and why it matters\nModi's BJP ahead in Haryana election but trails in Kashmir\n\u201cThe BJP made this election into a sort of referendum on its decision [to revoke Article 370].  However, people voted in favour of the stand taken by the regional parties,\u201d he said.\nNoor Mohammad Baba, another political analyst in Kashmir, says the results reveal that the BJP\u2019s \"policies weren\u2019t popular\u201d in the region.\n\u201cThe result is a message to Delhi that they need to mend their policies towards Jammu and Kashmir,\u201d he added.\nOne surprising outcome of the election has been the poor showing by the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), led by former Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti.\nMufti, who earlier ruled in coalition with the BJP, has managed to win only three seats.\nResponding to a query about her party\u2019s poor performance, she said it was the \"people's choice\".\n\"Winning or losing is a part of politics. People feel that Congress and National Conference will give them a stable government and keep the BJP at bay. We respect their verdict,\" she added.\nAdditional reporting by Auqib Javeed in Srinagar\nIndia\nArticle 370 of the Constitution of India",

Modi called his visit a \"new chapter\" in ties.\n\"India will always be there for the progress and prosperity of the people of Maldives,\" he said.\nThe statements - and the Indian financial package - signal a significant improvement in relations between Male and Delhi, which have been strained since Muizzu came to power in November 2023.\nSoon after taking over, he chose to travel to Turkey and China - his visit to the latter in January was seen especially as a high-profile snub to India as previous Maldivian leaders traditionally visited Delhi first after being elected.\nAround the same time, India was angered by derogatory comments from three Maldivian officials about Modi.\nBut analysts say the country\u2019s ailing economy has made its leadership mend its ties with India.\nThe Maldives is staring at a debt default as its foreign exchange reserves have dropped to $440m (\u00a3334m), just enough for one-and-a-half months of imports.\nOn Monday, Muizzu said he held \"extensive discussions\" with Modi to chart \"a path for the future collaboration between our two countries\".\nHe thanked India and said the budgetary support would be \"instrumental in addressing foreign exchange issues\".\nThe two countries have also agreed on a deal to start talks on a free trade agreement.\nAhead of his meeting with Modi, Muizzu had\ntold\nthe BBC that he expected India to help the country as it has done in the past.\n\u201cIndia is fully cognisant of our fiscal situation, and as one of our biggest development partners, will always be ready to ease our burden, find better alternatives and solutions to the challenges we face,\u201d he said.\nWithout referring to his anti-India campaign, he said: \u201cWe are confident that any differences can be addressed through open dialogue and mutual understanding.\"\nThis was in contrast to his previous decisions, some of which were seen as a way to reduce Delhi\u2019s influence and forge closer ties with India\u2019s rival China.\nIn February, his administration allowed a Chinese research ship to dock in the Maldives, much to Delhi\u2019s displeasure. Some saw it as a mission to collect data which could be used by the Chinese military for submarine operations.\nMuizzu has however rejected the pro-China tag, calling his policies as \u201cMaldives First\u201d.\nBut the country also continues to depend on China, which has so far extended $1.37bn in loans.\nAdditonal reporting by Anbarasan Ethirajan\nNarendra Modi\nIndia\nMaldives",

        "full_content": "The Polish artist who painted Hindu gods in Indian palaces\nGetty Images\nStefan Norblin stayed in India for six years, during which time he painted several murals\nIn the year 1939, as German tanks and soldiers invaded Poland, a famous Polish artist and his film-star wife pawned off their jewellery and fled the country.\nStefan Norblin and Lena left behind their dream home, which they were in the process of building, and their entire artistic legacy in exchange for safety.\nThe couple aimed to seek refuge in America and travelled across Romania, Turkey and Iraq, finally arriving in colonial India, where they spent six years.\nTheir lengthy stopover resulted in the unlikely collaboration between the artist and Indian maharajas (rulers), and gave India some of its finest artworks that blend Western aesthetics with Indian iconography.\nBetween 1941 and 1946, several Indian kings commissioned Norblin to decorate their palaces with paintings, and even design their interiors in the art deco style - a modernist style that celebrates innovation and technology.\nNorblin rose to the occasion by painting beautiful murals of Hindu gods, entire scenes from Hindu epics Mahabharata and Ramayana and even the country's famed tigers, leopards and elephants in his characteristic blended style.\nHis paintings can be found in the Umaid Bhawan Palace in Rajasthan state - the home of the ruler of the erstwhile princely state of Jodhpur, which has now been converted into a luxury hotel - as well as the palace of the rulers of Morbi in Gujarat state.\nHe also painted portraits for the Maharaja of Ramgarh in Bihar state, but these artworks have been lost to time, says Claus-Ullrich Simon, an expert on Norblin, in Chitraanjali - a documentary which chronicles the artist's works in India.\nHis murals are grand and vibrant, infused with a sense of movement and emotion. They depict recognisable characteristics of the art deco style, like minimalist, elongated human figures, geometric shapes and bold colours; but they are fused with innovative interpretations of traditional Indian imagery, including the features and postures of Hindu gods.\nGetty Images\nOne of Norblin's paintings of goddess Durga\nNorblin was born in 1892 in Warsaw into a wealthy family of industrialists. His father wanted him to become a businessman and sent him to study commerce in Antwerp, Belgium. But Norblin's interests lay in painting, a gene he probably inherited from his great-uncle who was a descendant of a famous French painter.\nSo, a young Norblin quit his studies and set off for Europe, where he visited numerous galleries and made illustrations for magazines in Belgium, France and England, writes Agnieszka Kasprzak in the article The Unplanned Return of Stefan Norblin.\nHe later returned to Warsaw and took up work as a graphic artist, stage designer and book illustrator and gradually developed a fan-following among the social elite. Norblin was best known for his portraits.\nHe met and married Lena, his second wife, in 1933 and the influential couple lived a comfortable life in Warsaw. But World War Two uprooted them from their homeland and transported them to the shores of far-away India.\nThe couple first arrived in Bombay (now Mumbai) in British India, and were greeted by a confluence of cultures, religions and languages, says architect Rahul Mehrotra in Chitraanjali. Here, the couple set up home and Norblin began exhibiting his work in top galleries, attracting the attention of rich patrons.\nIn the 1930s and 40s, the art deco style was a huge trend in Europe, but it had not yet permeated the architectural landscape of India. But the sons of many of India's maharajas were exposed to the style when they travelled abroad to study.\nAnd so, when Maharaja Mahendrasinhji's son was building a new palace in Morvi (now Morbi) - which he christened The New Palace - he wanted it designed and furnished in the art deco style.\nGetty Images\nA Norbin artwork in the Maharani's suite in Umaid Bhawan Palace\nGetty Images\nMurals and mosaics designed by Norblin in the Umaid Bhawan Palace\nHe tasked Norblin with beautifying the interiors of the place with his paintings. The artist made massive murals depicting hunting scenes, Hindu god Shiva lost in prayer, portraits of the ruler's ancestors and imagery that captured the flora and fauna of the area. His human figures have a mix of dark and light complexions and a mystical, nymph-like quality.\nThe artist's next big commission came from Umaid Singh, who invited Norblin to decorate and design the interiors of the royal residence in Jodhpur. The request was perhaps the result of a shipping accident, which destroyed the furniture the maharaja had ordered from London, Kasprzak writes in her paper, Polish Artist At The Service of Maharajas.\nOne can see some of Norblin's finest work in the sprawling Umaid Bhawan Palace. Most captivating are his murals of the goddess Durga, who is often depicted riding a lion and slaying a demon. The goddess is also depicted having many hands, each carrying a lethal weapon.\nIn one of Norblin's paintings of Durga, the goddess looks almost like an Egyptian princess; in another, strokes of black paint give shape to the goddess, making her look almost like a shadow streaking across the wall.\nIn one of the rooms called The Oriental Room, Norblin has painted a series of six murals depicting important scenes from the Ramayana, including goddess Sita's abduction by the demon king Ravana and her walking into the fire to prove her chastity to her husband, Lord Ram. Norblin has also designed entire rooms in the palace, including the king's and queen's suites, the sitting room and dining areas.\nNational Audiovisual Institute Poland and Embassy of Poland in New Delhi\nNorblin painted the Hindu god Shiva at The New Palace in Morbi in Gujarat\nOver time, several of Norblin's paintings were damaged due to a lack of care, heat and humidity, but they have now been restored by the Polish government. His works have been exhibited in Poland and India, but they remain unknown to many. That's probably because the artist didn't enjoy the same amount of success after he left India for America.\nThe artistic community in San Francisco, where the family set up home, was not as welcoming of the Polish artist. He received few commissions and after a while, he stopped painting as his eyesight began to falter due to glaucoma. His wife, once a famous actress, took up work as a manicurist in a beauty salon to support them.\nThe family struggled to make ends meet and Norblin slipped into depression. In 1952, the artist took his own life, not wanting to become a burden on his family. With his death, the legacy of his paintings in India slipped into oblivion, until they were re-discovered by Claus-Ullrich Simon in the 1980s.\nSince then, a lot has been done to bring the artist's work back into the spotlight, but a lot more remains to be done.\nArt\nIndia",

        "full_content": "How India became a Test cricket powerhouse\nGetty Images\nLaxman and Dravid\u2019s epic 376-run stand at Eden Gardens against Australia in 2001 sealed a legendary win\nMore than 90 years after India\u2019s first Test match at Lord's in 1932, Rohit Sharma\u2019s team has made history. With a win over Bangladesh in Chennai last month, India now boasts more Test victories than losses, standing at 179 wins to 178 defeats across 580 Tests. Cricket writer Suresh Menon explores India's remarkable transformation into a Test cricket powerhouse.\nIn every field of human endeavour, there are moments when circumstances and people align, sparking change.\nIn popular music this happened with the Beatles, where four boys emerged from the same place at the same time and created a new sound.\nIn sport, such changes are usually led by a single player who has around him a bunch who are almost as good. It happened in football with Pele as Brazil won three of four World Cups between 1958 and 1970 with him in the side.\nWith the arrival of a baby-faced Sachin Tendulkar, the fortunes of Indian cricket changed. His supporting cast was just as important to the transformation: Anil Kumble, Javagal Srinath, Zaheer Khan, Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag, VVS Laxman, Sourav Ganguly, Harbhajan Singh and MS Dhoni. Many would find a place in a team of all-time India greats.\nBefore Tendulkar\u2019s debut in November 1989, India had won just 43 Tests and lost more than twice that number out of the 257 matches played. The remaining were draws.\nIn the Tendulkar era, India registered 78 wins against 60 losses out of the  217 matches played.\nBut it was a period when the number of draws - 79 - was still significant. Only seven wins had come in the \"SANE\" countries: South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and England. Draws in these countries were still seen as victory of sorts \u2013 the mindset with which India began international cricket.\nGetty Images\nThe fortunes of Indian cricket changed with the arrival of Sachin Tendulkar\nDomestically, changes were happening. Led by Ganguly, and carried forward by Dhoni, India were discovering players beyond the traditional centres. If you were good enough, it didn\u2019t matter where you were from; you would get your chance. This was despite the cricket board itself and the various local bodies often being drenched in politics.\nTendulkar retired in 2013, and since then India have won 58 while losing just 29 Tests of the 106 played. Significantly, there have been only 19 draws.\nIndia won back-to-back series in Australia as they matched their rivals for aggression and in self-belief. This was no longer merely a cricketing change now, it was a psychological one.\nVirat Kohli occasionally went beyond the pale as skipper, but he was passionate about Test cricket and passionate about winning - an attitude that seeped into the team.\nSet to chase 364 in his first Test as captain in Adelaide in 2014, India nearly pulled it off and lost the match by just 48 runs.\nIt was a turning point. A new approach was created. Kohli, who led India in most Tests, at 68, was allergic to draws. It meant India played positive cricket at all times. Kohli drew just 16% of his Tests, the lowest among the top six captains in history. Even Clive Lloyd had 35% draws.\nGetty Images\nVirat Kohli's intense passion for Test cricket and winning inspired his team\nKohli had a talented bunch around him \u2013 Cheteswar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ishant Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja, KL Rahul. Again, players were discovered outside the traditional centres.\nAnother psychological change was that India no longer worshipped at the altar of orthodoxy. Effectiveness was more important than style. Jasprit Bumrah, who fast-tracked into international cricket, and is possibly India\u2019s greatest fast bowler, might not have made it in earlier generations. He is unorthodox; coaches would have recommended some other profession.\nThe cricket board too finally began to react to regular defeats abroad \u2013 India lost all Tests to Australia and England in a six-month span in 2011-12.\nThe golden generation was retiring. Much was made of the ineffectiveness of domestic cricket. The board decided that pitches had to help quick bowlers. It instructed curators to retain 3mm to 8mm grass on pitches. The result over a period was two-fold. India discovered a group of talented fast bowlers while also ensuring the batters could play fast bowling better.\nYou needed fast bowlers to win abroad consistently. The low points of Indian cricket can usually be traced to their weakness against fast bowling. In Manchester in 1952, they were dismissed twice on the same day \u2013 for 58 and 82 \u2013 as Fred Trueman and Alec Bedser ran through the side.\nIn the \"Summer of 42\" at Lord\u2019s in 1974, they folded for 42 thanks to Geoff Arnold's and Chris Old's dominant bowling. It gave rise to one of the most cruel cartoons in sport, with a woman telling her husband emerging from the toilet, \u201cYou should have gone home. Now you have missed the entire Indian innings.\u201d\nAFP\nIndia's 36 all out in Adelaide 2020 was seen as a freak occurrence, inspiring neither panic nor cartoons\nHowever,\nIndia\u2019s dismissal for 36 at Adelaide in 2020\ninspired neither cartoons nor panic. That was accepted as a freak innings where every good ball picked a wicket and there were hardly any bad balls. But it required great confidence to pass it off as one of those things \u2013 that confidence carried India to victories in two Tests that followed, and with it the series.\nThere was a phase, 2002-2004, when India won Tests at Port of Spain, Leeds, Adelaide, Multan and Rawalpindi. But only in Pakistan did they win the series. Veteran writer David Frith thought India then had the finest Top 6 batting line-up in the history of the game. There was both heft and elegance, a rare combination.\nBut that team did not live up to its potential. This is one of the ironies of Indian cricket - that their most celebrated team did not dominate as they should have.\nWhat the current team has is heart. That 36 in Adelaide and\n78 in Leeds\nserve to highlight the temperament of players who can let bygones be bygones and remember only the good times. It is a rare quality in an individual, even rarer in a team.\nIn the past, Indian teams always had a couple of outstanding individuals on whom everything rested. With Sunil Gavaskar dismissed, half the team was gone. If the great spinners were collared, there was no one to turn to until Kapil Dev came along, and if he had a bad day, that was that.\nGetty Images\nJasprit Bumrah, India\u2019s greatest fast bowler, might not have thrived in earlier generations of cricket\nIn the 1960s, India won only one series abroad, in New Zealand. That helped consolidate India\u2019s biggest strength: spin bowling. That most romanticised generation led by a Nawab, Mansur Ali Khan of Pataudi, with its essentially amateur spirit was necessary. Just as necessary was the one represented by Tendulkar, when India performed with greater consistency.\nAll this was before the Kohli-led bunch of professionals could emerge. When India were first ranked No.1 in 2009, they had not won a series in Australia, South Africa or Sri Lanka. Now only South Africa remains.\nIndian cricket has moved on, and now we are looking at the end game of the recent stars: Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja. Already,  Rishabh Pant, Bumrah, Shubhman Gill, Yashaswi Jaiswal and a host of emerging fast bowlers have indicated they are ready to take over. India play five Tests in Australia starting in November.\nSuddenly the pressure is on Australia. The Tendulkar generation constructed a solid foundation, the Kohli-Sharma one has built on that. At the end of the Chennai Test against Bangladesh, India\u2019s wins outstripped losses, 179-178 in 580 Tests. Statistical evidence of a new India, if such were needed.\nIndia",

Sandip Roy reports.\nIn February 2023, Kolkata celebrated 150 years of its tramways with music, cake, a beauty parade of vintage trams, including a century-old wooden car, and a cheerful tram conductor, Roberto D\u2019Andrea, who travelled all the way from Melbourne, Australia.\nMelbourne and Kolkata boast two of the oldest operational tramways in the world. Melbourne\u2019s trams date back to 1885. Kolkata\u2019s first tram, a horse-drawn one, started in 1873.\nThat\u2019s where the similarities end.\nMelbourne's tram system is going strong despite the government once attempting to get rid of them. The system has been upgraded and some trams are solar-powered.\nIn pictures: India's fading trams\nKolkata\u2019s trams have been steadily declining over the years. From 52 routes in the 1970s, down to 25 in 2015 and now to just three.\nThe tram cars rattle and wheeze, having not been updated in years. Even the signs inside have not changed. \u201cBeware of pickpockets\u201d, \u201cNo change available for 100 rupees ($1.19; $0.89) or 50\u201d and \u201cTo stop the car please ring the bell only once\u201d.\nNow, the state government has announced that it wants to do away with trams entirely, save for one small loop as a heritage route.\nBut a dogged group of tram activists is fighting back.\n\u201cIt's a huge backward step as cities worldwide are 'decarbonising transport' because of global warming and climate change,\u201d says Mr D\u2019Andrea, who has helped foster a Kolkata-Melbourne tram friendship over the years.\n\u201cMore than 400 cities run tram systems. Cities that dismantled their tramways are rebuilding  them at great expense in places like Sydney and Helsinki and all over France. Hong Kong runs trams at high frequency on narrow streets,\u201d he says.\nIndia's oldest trams may soon be brought to a halt\nBut West Bengal transport minister Snehasis Chakraborty told the media: \u201cThe population and vehicular count of Kolkata have multiplied several times but the city\u2019s roads have not widened. Road space continues to hover around 6% which is way less than Mumbai\u2019s 18% and Delhi\u2019s 10%.\u201d\nBoth those cities once had trams. Mumbai had double-decker ones. Both have done away with them, leaving Kolkata as the only Indian city to hold onto the trundling streetcars.\nIn a way they have become emblematic of the city itself.\nThe city has other landmarks - the steel Howrah bridge, the white-domed Victoria Memorial monument, the colonial buildings in the city\u2019s centre. But just as London has its iconic red double-decker buses, Kolkata has its trams. The ding-ding sound of the first tram of the day rattling down streets was the alarm clock many in Kolkata woke up to.\nThey are a familiar sight in films made in the state.\n\u201cI have used trams in two of my films and the tram depot as well,\u201d says filmmaker Anjan Dutt.\nMahanagar (1963), by celebrated filmmaker Satyajit Ray, opens with a stunning two-minute-long tram sequence, sparks flying from the overhead cables before the camera moves inside to settle on the protagonist's tired face as he returns home from work. Here, the tram stands in for the city itself,  both its dreams and the daily grind.\nIn fact, Kolkata\u2019s Belgachia tram depot, once bustling with workmen repairing, maintaining, even building trams, nowadays often doubles as a film set. \u201cEven on a working day I saw films being shot in the workshop,\u201d says Subir Bose, a tram company worker who retired in 2022 after 39 years of service. \u201cA Kolkata film means they have to show a tram.\u201d\nGetty Images\nIn 1902, Calcutta, as Kolkata was known then, became the first Asian city with electric trams\nTrams are very much part of the history of the city and its sense of itself.\nIn 1902, Calcutta as it was known then, became the first Asian city with electric trams. Even after independence, the Calcutta Tramways Company was run from London and was listed on the London Stock Exchange till 1968. The cars were built by companies with names like Burn Standard and Jessop.\nAnd it wasn't just a transportation system. The tram lines knit the city together.\nWhen bloody Hindu-Muslim riots gripped Calcutta during\npartition in 1947\n, tram workers patrolled the city in empty trams to help restore normalcy.\n\u201cMy own father helped save some people from a mob,\u201d says tram driver Gopal Ram. \"Tram workers were like a family. It didn\u2019t matter if you were Hindu or Muslim.\u201d\nMr Ram\u2019s great grandfather Antu Ram was a tram employee from the steam-powered days. His grandfather Mahavir and father Jagannath worked for the trams as well. Mr Ram retired recently, the fourth and last generation of his family in Kolkata trams.\nIn some ways, the mystery is that Kolkata\u2019s trams have survived this long.\n\u201cIn the 1950s and 60s, during the personal automobile boom, people were getting rid of trams everywhere, not just in India,\u201d says transport consultant Suvendu Seth.\n\u201cNow they are making a comeback. The light rail in many cities in the United States is just a newer version of trams. It\u2019s sad that we had it all the time and are neglecting it instead of improving it.\u201d\nMr Seth says that instead of complaining about lack of road space, an innovative solution could be to make some roads open only to pedestrians and trams.\nAFP\nRoberto D\u2019Andrea, an Australian tram conductor, travelled to Kolkata last year to celebrate 150 years of its trams\nDebashis Bhattacharyya, a retired academic and president of the Calcutta Tram Users Association, thinks trams survived in Kolkata all these years because they connected the city\u2019s schools, hospitals and cinemas.\nIn the 1990s, as the count of cars and buses increased, the then Communist government in the state called trams \u201cobsolete\u201d and wanted to get rid of them.\n\u201cI protested,\u201d says Mr Bhattacharyya. \u201cIf trams went, I felt my whole existence was threatened. I did exhibitions, slide shows, brought in foreign experts. The government should be applying for UNESCO heritage status for trams instead of trying to kill it off. \u201d\nRecently, activists have been trying to use culture to save trams.\nSince 1996, filmmaker Mahadeb Shi has been organising the Tramjatra festival, often in collaboration with Mr D\u2019Andrea. Art students paint the trams and local bands perform in the streetcars.\nEach Tramjatra has a theme, like Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s Gitanjali or the city\u2019s Durga Puja festival.\n\u201cTramjatra helped expose younger people to trams too,\u201d says Shi.\nOne north Kolkata tram route was reopened recently. The West Bengal Transport Corporation also tried to make trams cool again with special projects like a tram library, an Independence Day special tram and a short-lived Tram World museum.\nAFP\nTrams were once part of plans to make Kolkata\u2019s transportation all-electric by 2030.\nWhen Kolkata received a\nC40 Cities \u201cGreen Mobility\u201d award\nin Copenhagen in 2019, mayor Firhad Hakim said trams were a key part of his vision to make the city\u2019s transportation all-electric by 2030.\nBut now he seems to have forgotten that pledge. The government admits trams are a \u201cgreen\u201d mode of transport but says they are investing in other forms instead - electric buses and cars and expanding the underground metro system.\nMr Bhattacharyya says tram routes have been gobbled up by tuk-tuks which generate more employment and votes for the government. The tram depots also sit on valuable real estate the government can sell.\nBut Shi insists the final bell hasn\u2019t rung yet, as the issue is now with the Calcutta High Court, which formed an advisory committee last year to explore how Kolkata\u2019s tram services can be restored and maintained, with the state awaiting the committee's report before taking further action.\nMr Bose, the retired tram worker, says the government could have shut down the trams long ago, but that something held it back every time. Perhaps because it too senses what trams mean for the city, he says.\n\"Three things made Kolkata Kolkata - the Howrah Bridge, the Victoria Memorial and the trams. It\u2019s heart-breaking to think we could be losing one of them.\u201d\nSee also:\nIn pictures: India's fading trams\nKolkata\nIndia",

Why is he singing like this?\" says Sriram.\nBut he didn\u2019t let the early criticism stop him and has largely let his music do the talking.\nThis year he became the first South Indian to perform at Coachella, opened for US indie star Bon Iver on his US tour and is about to embark on the UK leg of his All Love No Hate tour.\nIt will be his biggest solo UK show, in front of a crowd at the O2 Arena in London.\n\"I\u2019ve always had the vision to take our music and elevate it to the highest level,\"  Sriram explains to BBC Asian Network's\nTamil and South Indian music show\n.\n'A cultural bridge'\nA wave of South Asian musicians have been appearing in mainstream spaces and collaborating with western artists.\nPunjabi megastar Diljit Dosanjh featured on The Tonight Show, AP Dhillon worked with Stormzy and Arijit Singh brought out Ed Sheeran at his concert.\nSriram says the success of these artists inspires him to do the same with his Carnatic style.\n\"My mission since the beginning has been to take my Carnatic musical roots and amplify them across the globe,\" he says.\nSriram, who is best known for songs such as Srivalli, Kalaavathi and Neeli Neeli Aakasam, says he felt \"the world wasn't ready\" when he first entered the West.\n\"Now, over a decade later, it\u2019s clear to me that the world is not only ready for this perspective, but they need it.

        "full_content": "India's top court saves a poor student's college dream\nAmit Saini\nAtul Kumar studied for hours even during power cuts\nAtul Kumar, 18, was ecstatic when he found out in June that he had passed a tough examination that would allow him to join a prestigious technology college in India.\nBut then came the next step: paying 17,500 rupees ($281; \u00a3156) online to confirm his admission. It was a big amount for the family from Muzaffarnagar in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.\nHis father managed to borrow the money, but Atul says he missed the online fee deadline by a few seconds, partly due to technical issues.\nThe family didn't give up, filing petitions and court cases. This week, India's top court stepped in and ordered the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Dhanbad, to restore Atul's admission.\nThe Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers granted by India's constitution, saying that \"we cannot allow such a young talented boy to go away\".\nThe IITs are India\u2019s top technology institutes, attracting more than a million candidates for nearly 18,000 seats in 23 colleges spread across the country. Students spend years in private coaching centres to prepare for the exams, and parents believe joining an IIT is a ticket to success.\nAtul's story has made headlines in India because of his financially deprived background and the challenges he overcame.\nAtul's parents found it hard to raise the online admission fee\nAtul is from the Dalit community, which lies at the bottom of India\u2019s caste hierarchy and is among the most marginalised in the country.\nHis father Rajendra Kumar earns about 450 rupees ($5; \u00a34) a day as a daily wage labourer and his mother weaves cots at home.\nBut Rajendra Kumar says that nothing was more important to him than his children's education. He even sold his house once to fund his eldest son\u2019s studies, he told the BBC.\nTwo of Atul's brothers are studying engineering at reputed colleges, while a third is doing a bachelor's degree from a college in Muzaffarnagar.\nAtul knew he also had to study hard, and he did that for hours every day in a dark corner of his house which got little sunlight. Erratic electricity supply made things worse, with daily power cuts lasting hours.\nRajendra Kumar says buying an inverter didn't make sense as it cost nearly 25,000 rupees.\n\"But I would have sold the house [again] if needed,\" he adds.\nAtul had joined a free coaching centre for marginalised students in a nearby city, and this year was his last out of the two attempts allowed in IIT entrance examinations.\nWhen Atul passed the exam, his father asked for help from a local moneylender. But the man backed out two hours before the fee deadline.\nThe father then had to turn to his friends, who immediately chipped in with 14,000 rupees. Rajendra Kumar dipped into his savings for the remaining 3,500 rupees.\nHe quickly deposited the amount in his eldest son\u2019s bank account, while Atul logged in to complete the formalities.\nBy then, he had just 180 seconds left for the deadline.\n\u201cWe tried to complete the task that requires many more minutes\u2019 work in three minutes,\u201d Rajendra Kumar said.\nBut the portal froze suddenly, he says, and Atul missed the deadline.\nIn shock, no-one in the family ate for a day.\nWikimedia commons\nThe IITs are India\u2019s top technology institutes\nAtul\u2019s coaching centre reached out to IIT Dhanbad but his petition says they did not help him. The desperate family wrote emails to several college authorities and moved another court, but nothing worked.\nThe only option left now was the Supreme Court. In 2021, the court had allowed a Dalit student to join IIT Bombay after he also couldn't pay his admission fee on time due to financial and technical difficulties.\nAtul and his father contacted that student who put them in touch with the lawyer who fought his case.\nIn the Supreme Court, IIT Dhanbad argued that Atul had logged into the payment portal at 3pm, which indicated that it was not a last-minute attempt. It also pointed out that Atul was sent multiple reminders through text messages, well before the deadline.\nBut the court asked IIT why it was so keen to oppose his admission.\nThe court observed that there was no reason why the petitioner would not have paid the amount if he had the means to do so and ordered IIT Dhanbad to create an additional seat for Atul in the current batch.\nThe Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud then wished him luck in his studies.\n\"All the best, do well!,\" he said.\nIndia",
